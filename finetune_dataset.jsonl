However, I think that the class attendance should be optional for students. There are three reasons to argue optional attendance. First, the adults have freedom to make own decisions. The university students are matured enough to be responsible to their decisions. Less attendance will results into less opportunity to learn. If a student decided to take the risk, the successive results is all his or her matter. Second, it is not efficient to have the attendance as one of the scoring criteria. The score is a metric to measure how the student understand the course materials. If a student already has perfect understanding, he or she should have good score. There is no need to attend the class only for grading. Therefore, nice grading system should not include the attendance. Third, the professor can instruct the students who are more willing to learn. Not all students want to learn a lot in the class. They just attend the class, and do something else. However, it makes the class atmosphere worse. Free attendance can solve the problem by releasing just-attenders. It will leave the students who want to learn something in the class. In short, the attendance is not really important in the university. The students are aged enough to choose own attendance. Moreover, the attendance causes several inefficiencies. The class can be more effective without the attendance.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 is justified because while the essay presents three reasons against mandatory attendance, it lacks depth in the arguments, such as the statement 'Less attendance will results into less opportunity to learn,' which is vague and not fully developed.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, as it presents an introduction followed by three distinct arguments, although the transitions between points could be more fluid to enhance overall coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors, such as 'requires the attendance in the class' and 'the adults have freedom to make own decisions,' which detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Students enter to university because they want to earn something. However, attendance of class is another point of view. Some people say it is student's own optional property, but that is not simple like that. First of all, attandance is not only for that one student alone. Attending class is not only for students but also for professors. They interaction each other and they learn some basic rule, manner. If students think attendance is optional, than almost of them would not go to class at all. Other studenants who just go to class also can think attendance is not needed anymore. Than, professors may think why the class should be continue. Furthermore, absense at all class and single attendance for test is such a ignoring the objective of professor. Students who thinks attend to class is optional because they can learn or study themselves. But, all each lecture of professor is very differents to course of syllabus. His objective, point of view, some new information that only he can give, and how to solve the problem is most important and that is basically why we enter the university. Finally, attending the class is best way to evaluate students about how they can control themselves. If there is one student who attend every class and another student who except 4 class, it means simply first student control his study schedule and make the promise between professors and students. Students pay the huge amount of money for entering university. They might be able to think attendance is their own rights in our capitailism society, but reality is more complecated. To find more good thing in university, students should attend to all class.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument about the importance of class attendance, supported by points such as the interaction between students and professors, but it lacks specific examples or evidence to strengthen its claims, particularly in discussing the benefits of attendance.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 reflects that while the essay has a logical flow, it suffers from unclear transitions and sentence structure, as seen in phrases like 'But, all each lecture of professor is very differents to course of syllabus' which disrupts the clarity of the argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to numerous grammatical errors, such as 'attandance' instead of 'attendance' and 'single attendance for test is such a ignoring the objective of professor', which detracts from the overall readability and professionalism of the essay."}]}

But, I think there are some reasons for selecting attendance for university student. I'll discuss why they do not need to attend class. First, the class is not the best way for studying to several students. Students could improve their studying environment in various way, for example, search on google, paper sites, or even exploring some places. It means, not only the class is the best way for studying. To supply effective studying environment, we should think fit method for each student, and one of the easiest way is do not merge them through the class. Second, there are more chances for improving their lifestyle. Lifestyle, I mean, can be responsibility, time managing, or planning. They could get those experience through more selective class than before. Third, Attendance is just working on dividing grades. There is possibility that some students do not have any interests on class due to speed of instruction, their condition, etc, however, almost of them just sit on the chair, for getting their attendance points. Could you say it is proper situation for education? I think it isn't. From now on, I suggest three reasons that we should not force students to attend class - The class can not be the best way for studying, there are more chances for improving their lifestyle, Attendance is just working on dividing grades. I think we should give more various way for student, and the start point is do not force them to attend class.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's exploration of valid points, such as the assertion that 'the class is not the best way for studying to several students,' but it lacks depth and thorough examples to effectively support these claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is justified by the lack of clear transitions between ideas, such as jumping from discussing study methods to lifestyle improvements without a cohesive flow, which makes the essay harder to follow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, as seen in 'one of the easiest way is do not merge them through the class,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some students argue that the attendance check is important to make good study atmosphere and to evaluate students\u2019 attitude for class. However, I believe that the attendance is optional for students. There are several reasons on following essay. First of all, involuntary attendance check makes bad class environment. Students who do not want take class just come class to take attendance point. They are not interested in class, so they sleep in class or work other things in class. This situation will disturb other students\u2019 study. If the free-attendance check is carried out, students who want to study in class take the class spontaneously and they also can get good grade. Secondly, the attendance check prevents growth of social skills. The university students are adults. They have responsibility to take or absent their class. After their graduation, no one is not interested in their life. They must go to work for themselves. The forceful attendance check disrupts students\u2019 independence. Many people emphasize the attendance for students. But the attendance check can make bad class atmosphere and to disrupt social senses for independence. Therefore, It is good that the students take the class voluntarily with optional attendance check.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay mentions that 'the attendance check prevents growth of social skills' without providing sufficient examples or evidence to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the essay's unclear structure, particularly in the transition between ideas, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing class atmosphere to social skills without clear connections.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'no one is not interested in their life,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

These days, some students believe that going to class is optional and unnecessary. However I have two reasons that attending class is required. First, lecture is not only focused on giving academic information by the professor. By the lecture, students can make the relationship with professors and communicate with other students. We will get great experience by interacting with different and various people. We can much develop our academical thinking and learn how to communicate with a lot of people. Second, as more student attends the class, the quality of class becomes higher. Even though professor is how smart or excellent, talking alone in the class is not effective and exhausting. Professor can check the understanding by seeing the students and give questions to them. These interaction will make the lecture better and quality of lecture become higher.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's strength in presenting two reasons for attending class, but it lacks depth and specific examples to support these claims, such as failing to elaborate on how relationships with professors directly enhance academic success.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 indicates a need for clearer structure, as the essay jumps between ideas without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the argument, for instance, the transition between discussing relationships and class quality is abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is justified by the use of some effective phrases, like 'great experience by interacting with different and various people,' but it is undermined by grammatical errors such as 'as more student attends' instead of 'as more students attend,' which detracts from overall clarity."}]}

Some professors don't care about the attendance but the other includes the attendance in grade. In my opinion, university students should not be required to attend classes. First of all, they take classes by paying their money. They decide to enroll in university and take a class by themselves. All of these are their choices. So, attending the class also should be one of choices. There is no reason for interfering there freedom. Deciding importance of attendance is up to students. Furthermore, attending the class could be not the best choice for learning something. Attending the class could be wasting time for some students who already know about contents of the class because there are many similar class in university or they study that contents in advance. Therefore, students could receive a good grade without attending the class. In that time, they can do other valuable things and develop themselves. In conclusion, attending the class should be optional for students. Because, the choice is individual freedom and attendance is not the best decision for learning for someone.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified because while the essay presents a clear opinion against mandatory attendance, it lacks depth and specific examples to support the argument, such as the claim that attendance could be a waste of time for students who already know the material.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is warranted as the essay has a basic structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but it suffers from a lack of clear transitions and connections between ideas, making it difficult to follow the flow of the argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate given that the essay uses some appropriate vocabulary, but it contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'interfering there freedom' instead of 'interfering with their freedom,' which detracts from overall clarity."}]}

First, if universities allow students not to attend classes, it might cause students to get lazy because students might not be able to see what other students are doing or get lost through curriculum. This can be proven by current online class environment where most students push back recorded lectures until exam or never see the videos. On the other hand, when students go to the classes, they can focus on the classes on given hours and also check their knowledge and communicate with professor and other students. Second, It is much more better to be taught by professor than studying by oneself. Even though one may know almost every class materials, professor can give special knowledge and experiences which would never be acquired without class. it does more apply to major classes because most major classes is given by a professor who researched for that class subject over ten years. professors can give students their laboratory experiments of textbook contents or explain real applications in industry for better understanding of vague scientific principles. Therefore, with above two reasons, I recommend students to attend classes and follow class contents with most professional instructions and communication with other participants.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents valid reasons for attending classes, such as the potential for students to get lazy without in-person instruction, but it lacks depth in exploring counterarguments or additional benefits, which weakens the overall argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate because the essay is structured with a clear introduction and two main points, yet transitions between ideas could be improved for better flow, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing laziness to the benefits of professor-led instruction.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the use of mostly clear language, but errors such as 'It is much more better' and inconsistent capitalization of 'professor' detract from the overall quality of writing."}]}

There were various reasons for perception and absence. Sometimes there were days when I couldn't go to sleep because of many tasks. Another day was caused by excessive drinking. This behavior adversely affected my grades, and for whatever reason, I still have great regret for my behavior. Except for my personal wishes, I think attendance at university is not very important. I believe that going to classes should be optional for students. University education is not about teaching integrity. It is about teaching the knowledge of the majors. Therefore, the evaluation should focus on achievement of majors, not focus on integrity. Most students who are absent and late will not be able to easily understand the content of the class, which will lead to low achievement. They will receive low grade even if they do not evaluate about their integrity. However, in some cases, despite showing an unfaithful attitude, some students could get good understanding of their major. This is not a problem at all. If they understand everything without taking a class, that's why they don't have to attend class. Also, it's meaningless to take attendance now, as Corona 19 makes a non face-to-face class. As classes were conducted online, classes could be taken regardless of time and place. But forcing students to take lectures at a given time would reduce the advantages of online. Also, if taking online, it may be difficult to take a lectures at a given time due to technical problem. Checking attendance is not easy work. The significance of checking attendance is to encourage participation, but in fact, attendance is not effective in checking integrity or paying attention to class. Attendance just checks if students have attended. Even if the students are sleeping throughout the class or watching their cell phone, they will receive a perfect score for attendance. If professors want to make students truly participate in the class, they should find another way rather than simply checking attendance. For example, they can get a better effect by evaluating factors such as whether you have done your tasks for the class or actively responded to the professor's questions.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's clear argument against mandatory attendance; however, the example of excessive drinking as a reason for absence lacks depth and fails to effectively connect to the main argument about the importance of attendance.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the essay's general flow of ideas, but the transitions between points are weak, such as the abrupt shift from discussing online classes to the ineffectiveness of attendance checks without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is supported by the generally clear expression of ideas, but instances of awkward phrasing, such as 'the absence of perception,' detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay."}]}

But also, professors have rights to check attendance for grading the students. If professor decided to check attendance, students should follow it. When students want to be absent on class, then they should suggest proper reasons for absence to professor. Second, diligence should be scored. For example, One student already knew most of lecture, so he absent most of lecture. Another student attended every classes and study hard. But two students got same grade because of middle & final exam. I think this is unfair. Not only the knowledge, but also the diligence is very important skill for student.

The first reason is that grading has to be made not only with their ability but also the effort they spent. The second reason is that attending classes makes the quality of class better. The final reason is that it makes students study. Grading should not be made only with their ability. I think the university is an institute that teaches a student to make them better. If we grade them only with their ability, there will be no valuation of how much the student has improved with their effort. Checking attendance can protect the basic principle of universities: improving. Without attending classes, it deteriorates the quality of classes. The class have to be a place that every student discusses each other to improve every students' skill. If attending is not required, there will be fewer students who attend the course and eventually, the essence of the class, the frequency of discussions will get lower. Making students study in a compulsive manner can actually be a good stimulant. For example, students study a lot before the midterm and final exams. The test makes them study even if they don't really want to do it. Giving a penalty to the students who do not attend can show the same effects. They will go to the classroom and study even if they want to miss the class. A number of people think that the class attendance is not required. However, if students are required to attend the classes, their effort in studying cannot be reflected in their grades, the quality of the class will deteriorate, and students could not get any regulations to make them study hard.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects the essay's lack of depth, as the argument that 'grading should not be made only with their ability' is mentioned but not thoroughly developed or supported with specific examples or evidence.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is justified by the essay's somewhat disjointed flow, as the transition between points, such as moving from the importance of grading to the quality of class discussions, lacks clear connections and coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate given that while the essay generally communicates ideas clearly, there are grammatical issues, such as 'the class have to be a place' which should be 'the class has to be a place,' impacting the overall clarity."}]}

If they can't get higher education due to lack of best intelligence, many of the products we use cannot exist on our surroundings. Second, we should think about the purpose of the education. Education is to make society to be powerful and give some profit. But, if only genius can get higher education, it can be not the case. So, the personality should be great factor to get qualification. The genius can be lazy, or has no ability to communicate and not cooperative. Or, their personality is not that good for society of humans. For example, they can agree with painful experiment with human. Then, it is hard to say that the product is useful or desirable for human. Then, the higher education is useless because education is for society profit. Until now, I explained the reason why 'good students' means not just smart genius people. And next, I'll explain why the higher education should be not be available to bad students. First, bad student means not good intelligence and not diligent in their study. Then, it is not desirable for them to get education consistently. Because bad students means they are not talent, interested, and diligent in this area. So, it is more efficient for them to learn the other techniques to get other jobs. Second, bad students have higher probability to destroy the atmosphere. They will not cooperative, and may cannot follow the speed of good students. It may results in loss for both sides. Those are the reason why higher education should be given for smart, or diligent people. As said above, the purpose of the education is to give them good environment to study and to be useful people for society. So, whether it is fair or unfair, the higher education should be given to good students. It will be efficient for human society and for students who are bad or good.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a somewhat clear argument about the definition of 'good students' but is weakened by the assertion that 'bad students have higher probability to destroy the atmosphere,' which lacks sufficient evidence and explanation.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified as the essay presents ideas in a logical order, yet it suffers from unclear transitions, particularly between the discussion of 'good students' and 'bad students,' making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument smoothly.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to multiple grammatical errors, such as 'some people is not that smart' instead of 'some people are not that smart,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

If they can have responsibility in their behavior, they can do anything in their lives. So they don't have to go classes but they should accept their grades of classes. Second, university education course is not a duty in Korea. Students don't have to take an university education and they also have rights that they reject the classes. But as I already said in first reason, they should endure the reactions following when they go or don't go to classes. In last, classes exist to teach something to students. If students already understand about the contents of classes, they don't have to spend time in classes. They can do other thing like study other contents or take a rest. Using time effectively is good for students and professor both. Because of these reasons, I think going to classes should be optional for students. They are adults, so they can choose what they do or do not. And taking university classes are not duty unlike elementery school or middle school classes. I think they can decide go classes or not in their opinion.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified because the essay presents the argument that university classes should be optional, but it lacks depth and specific examples to support this claim, such as failing to provide evidence or real-life scenarios where optional attendance has been beneficial.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is warranted as the essay presents its ideas in a somewhat logical order, but it suffers from weak transitions and unclear connections between points, such as jumping from discussing adult responsibilities to the rights of students without a smooth flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is appropriate due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'they can do anything in their lives' and 'they can decide go classes or not in their opinion,' which hinder clarity and readability."}]}

However, I would like to say that the restriction for attendance is no longer helpful for the students. I would explain my opinion in the following essay. First of all, the classes held in university are additional for those who wants to listen to about the materials and ask a question. There are some students who have difficulties to understand the theme of classes without additional information, such as answers of their questions. However, the class materials are usually good enough, so a lot of students are fine to understand the whole class only with the materials. Thus, it does not have to restrict students to participate the real-time class with deduction of the score. Next, the classes could waste students' time. Almost every classes do not include fine quality information. Usually, the professors just read the material in their classes, and students are sleeping instead of listening to the class. This kind of class could bring a bad effect to the student. The efficiency of work is getting higher when someone is really willing to do that. So, if the student do another works, such as their homework, part-time jobs or leisure while the class time, and study about the class whenever they feels they are necessary to learn them, the whole efficiency would be higher than before. Thus, the study time for students should not be restricted by the class time. To summarize my point above, the class in university is not very helpful for every students who can understand the theme of the subject without the class, and sometimes it could be harmful for the efficiency of the works for students. By these points, I would urge that the attendance of class should be optional.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument against mandatory attendance, but it lacks strong supporting evidence; for example, the claim that 'the professors just read the material in their classes' is too generalized and not substantiated with specific instances or examples.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 reflects that while the essay has a clear introductory statement and a summary, the flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed, particularly in the transition between the points about class efficiency and the value of attendance, making it difficult to follow the argument cohesively.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted as the essay demonstrates an attempt at varied vocabulary, but frequent grammatical errors, such as 'some people thinks' and 'the students who can understand the theme of the subject without the class,' detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Students may have different opinion about this. Someone may think students should be required to attend classes. But the other hand other may think students don't have to attend classes. I have participated univiersity classes and my opinion is students should be required to attend classes. First of all, if students attend classes, when they may have question, they can ask their question to professor immediatly. We can have question while we participate classes because university study is difficult. And we may not solve the question because of leak of knowledge. However, professors have a lot of knoledge about major and they almost can solve our question. And I think this is huge advantage of attending classes. Second, we can discussion about major with friend. Some classes are discussion classes by professor. These classes need all students participate the class. I listen some discussion class, and I could get more opinion about subject and knowledge by discussion with friends. Although there are not discussion classes, students can ask something like missing information or simple question to their friends in classes. Last, professors can teach more efficiently. In this semester, one of my classes 's professor says \"I want to see my students face in real. Because I can know whether students understand or not by watching their face.\" So I thought attending classes is need for professor. If many students don't attend class, professor can't know about part which students feel very difficult. However if many students attend professor's class, they will question about part which they can't understanding. Then professor can teach more detail about this part and many students can learn their major easily. I think students should be required to attend classes because they can ask to professor and communicate with friends, and professor teach more efficeintly.

At the first, Korean school system maintained summer and winter vacations. It means, the most of students are adapted for the system. If the short vacations realized, there can be massive numbers of confused students. Then, for escaping the confusing, our society should consider about the totally different semester system for new students. This will occurs unfair chance problems for traditional students. The next, sometimes students need distance from school works. In the contemporary society, the studying is not the only subject for human life. there are so many outer activities which help students. Sports, trips, festivals, self studying, even though rest also required. But the short vacation cannot completely satisfy those outer subjects. Simply, they needs times. Our education system should recognize the several independent times from the school are useful. Not only the school semester system, also several workings, for example office working, allows long vacations for each years. The society already knows the importance of long vacation. Our life does not fulfilled with a piece of learning. By those reasons, I propose the long vacation for the students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 is justified because while the essay presents a clear opinion on the need for long vacations, it lacks depth in its arguments, such as when it states, 'the most of students are adapted for the system,' which is vague and does not provide specific evidence or examples to support the claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 reflects the essay's unclear structure, as the ideas seem to jump from one point to another without smooth transitions, evident when the author shifts abruptly from discussing student confusion to the need for distance from schoolwork.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is supported by the author's use of some varied vocabulary and sentence structures; however, errors such as 'This will occurs unfair chance problems' indicate grammatical issues that detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

However, there is a conflict between the one long vacation and short and often vacations. Although there are some people who insist the long vacation is better, short vacations are necessary for the students. First of all, vacation which is too long will make the students cannot study. If there is exaggerate space between the semesters, they may forget what they have learned in last semester. This brings more difficulties to students to study next semester's things. Therefore, students cannot study well when there is a long one vacation. Next, a Long semester gives bad effects to the students either. the students are being tired during the semester. They need some time to recharge. However, long one semester derived from long one vacation will block them to rest. Without rest, they will be exhausted while they think the semester is never-ending. These are the reasons for the necessity of short and often vacations. Too long work or too long rest does not help students. Only appropriate work and appropriate rest will make them happier.

Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year, and others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout year. I prefer to have one long vacation each year. There are two reasons why I prefer one long vacation. First of all, this is how I am. If I have several short vacations, It would make me grumpy and boring. As my major is electronic engineering, the study require me to use and apply previous theory that I learned before. Also as my study style is based on memory, I am going to forget and study again when I have several short vacations. Therefore, studying continuously without resting is more effective way to achieve. Secondly, one long vacation makes me more productive. To be specific, most of the people use the vacation for recharging their batteries and preparing next semester. Also they spend time for lots of valuable activity such as R&E(research program), Internship, travel. To do these things, the students need 2~3 months minimum. As I am KAISTian and have huge amount of things to study, I want to participate research program and Internship when I am free from exam.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nI think the vacation should be a long, not just the several short vacations. There are three reasons why I agree with the former opinion rather than latter, based on my experiences. First, to obtain some certificates of several departments during the vacation, we need a long period of time to prepare for test and re-test. For example, if we want to get a higher score on TOEIC in this vacation, some students will take an Internet-academy lectures, others will read through some books. It costs a time more than we expect to achieve our goals, because there's no guarantee that we'll pass the test at once. Second, many part-time jobs want to hire the people that can work as long as possible. For example, if you have a private lesson with middle or high school students, their parents want to contact with you as long as possible, for further feedback. However, if there are several short vacations for you, the flow of you and your student will cut off, and both you and student's parent will hesitate to keep your lessons going on. Not only the private lesson, but also some part-time jobs related to services like cafe or department store, owners don't want to hire some people that work only about 3~4 weeks. Third, to travel some foreign countries with friends or family members, long period of one vacation is quite convenient to plan and match with others' schedules. Let's think about we are planning for Europe trip with best friends. One friend can have a part-time job in every weekend, and another friend can have an important meeting on specific weekdays. In this case, you will have a trouble with making a golden time of your trip unless you have a long vacation. In conclusion, for my individual academic and economic achievements, and making a wonderful harmony with others' schedules, long period of time in vacation is necessary for me.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a lack of depth in the arguments presented, as evidenced by the reliance on examples that are somewhat vague, such as stating that 'many part-time jobs want to hire the people that can work as long as possible' without providing specific job types or contexts.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the somewhat disjointed flow of ideas, particularly in the transition between the second and third points, where the connection between part-time jobs and the need for a long vacation is not clearly articulated, leading to a lack of coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is supported by several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as the awkward construction 'the former opinion rather than latter,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

But for my opinion, I think just one long vacation each year is better than the other case. First, with several short vacations, we cannot complete any goal for the vacation. I usually make some goals for one vacation that I would complete in the period, and it usually take at least 1 month for completing one of them. But if there are only short vacations, then we would not do things fully and just leave them uncompleted. In other words, it would be waste of time. On the other hand, in long vacation, we can set several goals and also we can complete some of them, maybe all of them, so the vacation would be more valuable. Second, with several short vacations, we cannot have various experiences. When we take a rest in weekend, usually stay at home or just go out around home but this is because we have not enough time for go out far away, like abroad. Like this, with short vacations, we cannot go abroad especially far from our country, and this would reduce opportunities of experiences that we can get from there. Then it would reduce our site of view and it is not good for the development of not only ourselves but also our society. However, in long vacation, we can go anywhere since we have enough time and we could meet various people, experience other cultures and do some new things easily. It will help us to think in other ways and make us more creatively. Third, with several short vacations, we would have trouble to get some rest. As I mentioned in above one, people usually stay at home on weekend since we have not enough time for go out far away. And there's another reason of this, the things that we should do previously for the next weekday. In short vacations, we also have same trouble of these. For students, in example, they would have some homeworks that due to the next day of the holiday, or maybe they would have some test on next day of the holiday. It would make students to prepare for them, will exchange the time for rest as for study and make trouble to get some rest. But for long vacation, students would have enough time for both of preparing them and getting some rest. In short, we can complete our goals, have more experiences for long vacation and take some rest fully on the vacation, and this is the reason why long vacation is more valuable than several short vacations. For these reasons, I think one long vacation each year is better than several short vacations throughout the year.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects that while the essay presents multiple arguments in favor of long vacations, such as the ability to complete goals and gain experiences, it lacks depth in exploring the counterarguments or providing specific examples to support its claims more effectively.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 indicates a reasonable structure with a clear introduction and conclusion, but the flow between ideas could be improved, as seen in the abrupt transitions, such as moving from the discussion of rest to the challenges faced by students without clear linkage.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 illustrates some effective communication of ideas, yet it is marred by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'the things that we should do previously for the next weekday' which detracts from clarity and coherence."}]}

The opinion can be reasoned through the usage of the vacation. During the vacation, we can rest and have a chilling time doing hobbies. Having a fine vacation restoring for next semester is important, too. But I think long time is needed to achieve meaningful experience than just resting. For example, traveling with short term normally includes enjoying the traditional food or sports. Those activities are good to 'enjoy' the culture in one country, but usually not enough to 'understand' and 'learn' the culture and people who live in there. To earn wider perspective through the trip, I think longer period is needed. Furthermore, not for traveling, learning a new knowledge also needs long time. If we plan to learn new thing during the lifetime, it is much better to plan and succeed it through a long period. It also could be the vacation searching for a new vision by learning about different majors. Lastly, if we want to experience a social activity like intern, we need to get long vacation. There are many peoples who want to start social activity when they are in the undergraduate, and those activities usually acquires long time. To sum up, I propose having long vacation, because it gives time with higher quality with various activities.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay states that 'longer period is needed' for meaningful experiences but does not provide concrete examples of how longer vacations lead to greater understanding of culture beyond surface-level activities.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is warranted because, while there is a clear progression of ideas, the transitions between points are weak, such as the abrupt shift from discussing travel to learning new knowledge without clear connections.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is justified due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'not for traveling, learning a new knowledge also needs long time,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Though, when it comes to specifications, the thing seems to be quite controversial. Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. On the other hand, others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. For my opinion, it is better to have several short vacations. First of all, several short vacations enable students more relaxation. Why do we need vacation? Quite simple. Main purpose of the vacation is to give students time of relaxation and chance of new learnings at home, which are much different from that obtained from school. Some may reckon that one long vacation seems to ensure it better. In reality, it is not. Imagine that you have to study at school for a long long time. Or.. imagine that you must stay at home for a long long period, like quarantine. It should be dreadful whether it is school or home. Second, in reality, there are numerous problems. So far, in Republic Of Korea, most schools have given students several and short vacations which I've argued. Hard to change these conventional policies. For those reasons, I think that it is far better to give students short and several vacation times. It will be good choice for not only students, but all the peoples who are related to education.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay mentions that 'several short vacations enable students more relaxation' but does not provide sufficient evidence or examples to convincingly support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is warranted because, while the essay has a clear structure with an introduction and conclusion, the transition between ideas is often abrupt, as seen in the phrase 'In reality, there are numerous problems,' which lacks clear context or connection to the previous point.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is justified by the generally clear and effective communication, but it is slightly undermined by awkward phrasing such as 'the thing seems to be quite controversial,' which could be more effectively expressed."}]}

Every time the vacation is almost over, we often wish the vacation was longer, and we regret we could do more other things during the vacation. However, I think that I can do much more with short vacations than one long vacation and it will be even more helpful to prepare for the next semester, so I think it is better to have several short vacations than one long vacation. First of all, we can enjoy more when there are many short vacations. If there is only one vacation, it will be only in one season, summer or winter. Then, we can't play diverse sports. In my case, when I was a high school student, I could experience various things such as playing in the water in Saipan in summer and skiing in winter at Kangwondo. Not only these sports but also foods vary from season to season. Several short vacations spent eating warm food in the winter and cool food in the summer will be better than one long vacation with similar feelings each time. Secondly, short and many vacations can prepare for the next semester more fruitful than a long one. From the point of view of studying, which is one of the student's duties, it is said that short and multiple breaks increase concentration more than one long break. In other words, we can set more specific goals for the upcoming semester over several vacations, and we can take the next semester with a new mindset after each break. For example, during the vacation, I can make specific plans about what I lack, what I need more, and what I have to study, and since the vacation is not long, I can take a break and continue studying without getting tired. To summarize, short and many vacations are much useful for students than one long vacation. It is better to have several short vacations in that we can rest in more diverse ways during vacation. Besides this, it would be better to have short vacations that we don't lose our concentration and preparing for the next semester. It would be nice to have a longer vacation right now, but if you have a wider view, you will know how good short and many vacations are.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's effective argument for short vacations, but it lacks depth in examples, such as the vague mention of 'diverse sports' without specific details on how different vacations would facilitate this variety.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but it could be improved by more clearly delineating the connection between ideas, as seen in the abrupt transition between discussing sports and studying.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate due to generally clear expression, but it is weakened by awkward phrasing, such as 'short and many vacations are much useful,' which detracts from the overall fluency of the essay."}]}

I think vacation makes students work better during semester. So it is important to take enough extra curricular experience and take a rest. For these activity, vacation should be more often and a little shorter. I will explain why it is important. First, several short vacation makes student feel refreshed all year around. If students have only one vacation in a year, the students' academic efficiency will be decreased during semester because of the stress from test and homework. However, if students have several vacation, they will be refreshed often before burned out. And it will make their academic productivity better. Second, long vacation makes students forget last semester and be lazy. But when they have short vacation, students will not forget their last semester. So it is easy to come back to school's routine and follow the academic course again. Also, during short acation, students' bio-rythme is not be ruined so much. So students can come back to school's schedule easily. At last, short vacation makes sutdent enjoy various part of the year. For example, if students have only long summer vacation, they cannot enjoy thanks giving in fall, Christmas in winter and flower blooming in spring. This can ruin one people's life in school year. However, when there are several short vacations, students can join family's meeting in thanks giving and Chirstmas, and can enjoy summer vacation and party in spring. Moreover, this is not just for enjoying life. All these events with nature inspire students' research or other things. In short, several short vacations are good for students' coming back to school, inspiration and refreshment. It will be awkward at first, but as time goes, you can be sure for the positivity. Let's give students several short vacations.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a reasonable argument for short vacations, but it lacks depth, such as when the essay states, 'So it is important to take enough extra curricular experience and take a rest,' without elaborating on how these experiences contribute to student well-being.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear structure with an introduction and supporting points, yet it suffers from some awkward transitions, especially between ideas, such as the abrupt jump from discussing academic productivity to the enjoyment of seasonal events.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, exemplified by the phrase 'students' bio-rythme is not be ruined so much,' which undermines the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

In vacations, students can rest, reorganize, and study the lectures in next semester. Nowadays in Korea, two long vacations are given for each year, which are summer vacation and winter vacation. However, some people say that many short vacations are better than one long vacations. I agree with this argument. Instead of few long vacations, students should have a lot of short vacations. First, excessively long vacations are minus for students. If the length of vacation is more than 1 month, than many students may forget the information they had learn. Also, their study attitude and habits can be messed up during the long vacations. These can affect students in the bad way. Next, during the long semester, students must need some breaks. In Korea, the length of semester is almost 4 months. These are too much for growing children. They need some breaking periods during these semesters. If these breaking periods do not exist, then students can be easily tired off and may encounter burn-out. I think that two 1-month vacations(for summer and winter each) and four 2-weeks vacations for each year are good for students. In summer and winter, because of climates and temperatures, at least 1-month vacations must be given. But I think that 1 month is sufficient for these vacations. Also these vacations will be located between different semesters. During one semester, students need breaking periods. So I think that two 2-weeks vacations are appropriate for one semester. Then totally we have two 1-month vacations and four 2-weeks vacations in each year.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a solid argument for short vacations, but the essay lacks depth and supporting details, as seen in the statement 'excessively long vacations are minus for students,' which could be elaborated with specific examples or evidence to strengthen the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified because while the essay presents a clear structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion, the transition between ideas could be smoother, as indicated by the abrupt shift from discussing long vacations to suggesting a specific vacation structure without clear linkage.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to several grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, such as 'If the length of vacation is more than 1 month, than many students may forget the information they had learn,' which contains errors that hinder clarity and readability."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.    \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nHaving several short vacations throughout the year is better than one long vacation. There are Three reasons why I think like this. First, I think the most important reason why students have vacations is to take a rest and recharge their body and mind. If there are only one vacation through one year, semester would be very long and it makes students exhausted during the semester. So those students have lower will to study. But If there are several vacations, students can have free times for a couple of months between the semester. By this short vacation, students can have a rest or get their own free time before students get exhausted. Second, a long term vacation can disturb our focus on study. After the 4~5 months vacation, students are used to have a rest and meet friends or take a trip during long vacation so they can't focus on their study immediately. Also they might forget something related to their study so they have to learn that one more time. In contrast, during the short term such as 1~2 month vacation students are less likely to forget their knowledge and it is easy to get back on semester. Lastly, students can have more meaningful time during short vacation. If vacations are too long, people tend to delay their tasks because they think they can do those things after rest. But only 1~2 months are given to students, they would make a plan to use those time fruitful because it seems short. They can study what they want to know, have an internship program, or go travel. In conclusion, short vacation are good for student's efficiency and they can focus after short vacation. Also short vacations make students to have more meaningful vacations.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects a good argument for short vacations, but it lacks depth in supporting details, such as when the author mentions 'students can have a rest or get their own free time' without providing specific examples of activities that could enhance their break.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 indicates some logical flow, but the essay could benefit from clearer transitions between points, as seen when the second point about focus shifts abruptly from discussing vacation length to the impact on study retention.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors, like in 'there are only one vacation through one year,' which should be 'there is only one vacation throughout the year,' demonstrating a need for better grammatical accuracy."}]}

Some people may argue that higher education is not for everybody, but university gives lots of advantages for students who want to learn. First of all, university provides specific major subjects, which is not taught in high school. For example, KAIST has Industrial Design major courses with semi-professional equipment such as 3D printers. At university, people can use expensive but efficient machines to try out. Next, collage life itself is a special experience. Some students can performance poorly in academic parts, but that is not everything you learn in college life. In collage, you can make diverse friends and learn different cultures. You can get special lectures from scientist to filmmaker. Finally, college system has lots of advantages in encouraging students' academic performance and future career. There is more chance to get scholarship in collage. Undergraduate research programs helps students who want to research. It is easier to get internship because you have more information. Everybody who wants to get higher education should get it without being judged. There are many departments specialized in subjects. Collage life experience is not replaceable. University helps studying and developing future career path.

So many high school students who want to go to university can go to university even it is high level or not. So there are so many graduated people in the Korean society. I think it is not very good phenomenon for the society. First of all, societies' human sources would be simplized. There are many jobs in society, and humans need to do different roles in society. Although there are many kinds of majors in university, people would be similar when they get similar education in university. So there would be a lack of human in some part of the society because nobody can do that role and it has negative effect to the whole society. Second, higher education means the higher level of the high school's education. So it should be provided to students who successfully understand the high school's education. I think the university's higher education is the prize of the effort of the high school's education. Lastly, the quality of the university's education would be decrease when many students are taking it. Because professors of the universities should take care of lots of students,, they cannot take care of each student more, and the class would be much bigger. Even though there are some good big classes, big classes cannot get better qualities than smaller classes. So it could be a negative effect to the whole students. Even though I'm in KAIST and getting great education of the university so my opinion to this topic may seems selfish, I think university education should has advantages to the some good students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's exploration of the negative impacts of higher education accessibility, but it lacks depth and specificity, as seen in the statement 'there would be a lack of human in some part of the society because nobody can do that role', which fails to provide concrete examples or data to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is warranted due to the essay's unclear structure, particularly in the transition between points, as evidenced by the abrupt shift from discussing the oversupply of graduates to the role of professors, which disrupts the flow of ideas.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is justified by moments of awkward phrasing and grammatical errors, such as 'societies' human sources would be simplized', which not only contains a grammatical mistake but also uses the incorrect form of 'simplified', detracting from the overall clarity of the writing."}]}

There are several reasons that support my view. First, I think that there is no proper way to select \"good\" students. Some students, who have enough money, are already available with great education while others don't. Therefore, evaluating students to give a higher education itself would be unfair. Students who already can get high-quality education will easily pass the exam for evaluation. Secondly, higher education have to be provided to students who WANT to study more, not to students who are GOOD at studying. Everyone has the right to learn what they want to learn. It makes a much larger possible choices for people to select a right job. That diversity helps to form a creative and happy society. Some people may say that giving an lecture or providing various resources requires too much money to be available to all students. They insist that it is simply not effective. However, I think that the cost can be reduced by recording lecture video and provide it or just encourage students collaborate on studying. I also think that the social benefits that comes after good education are much greater than the cost. Everyone has the right to learn to make their lives better.

In my opinion, college or university education do not have to available to all students. First of all, some students do not have enough money to pay for college education. In other words, expensive college tuition are burden to them. Taking jobs without entering to college could be more appropriate way for them. But if social culture force them to enroll to college, they may regret about decision in future. Secondly, not all people needs college education for their living. There are uncountable jobs in world, and only part of them requires advanced skills or studies for work. For example, Office jobs or lots of service jobs do not requires college education. For them, enroll to college could be too luxury of time and money. Finally, not all students in college are interested in their lecture. I saw many students who sleep or playing with their smartphones during class. In other word, some students in college are already do not interest in their major. They could learn what they want to outside of university such as Internet or group study. Sum up, there are lots of people who can not taking college education or do not need to taking it. For those people, college education do not have to be essential. It have to remain as advanced course which is for students who desire for more studies after high school.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the author states that 'not all people needs college education for their living' but fails to provide substantial examples or evidence to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the essay's somewhat disjointed structure, particularly in the transition from discussing financial burdens to the argument about student interest, which disrupts the flow of ideas.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors, such as 'college or university education do not have to available' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Many middle school and high school(maybe elementary!) students study very hard to enter the college or university that they want. Importance of high educational process that they think doesn't mean college or university education really need to all of them. However, available to enter college or university is another argue. All of students don's need higher education with college or university, but if they want to high education, they can get the chance to learn. First of all, by college and university's purpose, to educate, higher education can be available to students that want to study with them. 'Good students' that college and university think is not clearly. Are they kind? Are they smart? Good students are determined just convenience of college or university. It is unfair, there are more better available policy, just want to higher education. Second, there are too many college and university. If only good student can enter college and university, most of college and university can't provide educational service with stable quality cause lack of students so lack of money that need to making contents of lecture, etc. More, higher education like lecture, lab session, etc need to some student for operate that like make question, tests(small quiz or exam, ...), so on. Education with no students is not meaningful. Entering the college or university is very confused problem in Korea. Many students who prepare to enter college or university thinks its very complicate and stressful issues. May college or university educations are available to all students that want to higher education, it make solution for that problems, and be nice for students and higher educational company in Korea.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a moderate understanding of the topic; however, the argument is weakened by vague statements such as 'Good students are determined just convenience of college or university,' which lacks clarity and fails to effectively convey the author's point.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is justified as the essay lacks a clear structure, demonstrated by abrupt transitions and the absence of a coherent thesis statement, such as the confusing sentence 'Entering the college or university is very confused problem in Korea.'\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 indicates a fair command of language, but there are numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrases, exemplified by 'don's need higher education with college or university,' which hinder the overall clarity and readability of the essay."}]}

First, because of technology, we can share education easily. In past, we should attend classroom to participate class. But, now we can easily watch lecture on online and do homework on computer. We do not have to go classroom and need physical space. So, it is easy to share education for all students. Second, it can grow up expert. One university can not provide all classes that someone need. For example, KAIST does not have professor who study fish. For raising expertise, we have to participate various classes from various universities. If, all students are available to higher education, they can watch what they need and raise expertise for their job. Third, there is no perfect way to select good students. All nobel prize winner do not come from harvard or standford. We can not identify students untill they actually work. All people have their own potential and it is not esay to check. If all students can learn higher educaion, they can grow their hidden potential and know what they really like and they are good at.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 is justified as the essay presents valid points for the availability of higher education, such as the mention of technology enabling online learning; however, it lacks depth and concrete examples to fully support the claims, such as specifics on how this access improves expertise.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 reflects a weak structure, as the essay presents ideas in a somewhat disjointed manner, for instance, jumping from the availability of online classes to the need for various universities without clear transitions or logical flow between points.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'we should attend classroom to participate class' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

If there are students who don't want to go to class, they can use phone or chat with friends. However, if students who want to go to class only go to class, they would concentrate on class. And it also makes other students to concentrate on class. Third, attendance check actually can't measure students' effort to study class' topic. By attendance, we can only check that students come to class. We can't check what students' actually do in class.

Every people are deserve to require knowledge for inhancing their skills, not just bounded in high level technology or complex philosophy. Some people might love handling flowers or others love sports. Refer to my relatives' experiment, they study their interest respectively by Youtube. I tried to find lectures for them from open-lecture archiving sites such as KMOOC, they do not contain entertainment major lectures. And I wondered why entertain relative subjects are not well organized as like as engineering or literature. Second reason that I side on educating all students is because I believe all people have potential to become a components of society by learning. I've seen a article which a chinese delivery man had solved difficult math problem that mathematic institute also tried. This is called as chinese version 'Good Will Hunting'. We do not know where or when to uncover genious people. I completely agree to offer university education for all students even they are not good on their field.

However, I think it is unfair that such higher education meant to be given just for good students. Let me introduce some reasons. First of all, of course, there can be a lot of difference in the speed of learning, so we should admit the fact and not have a system that seems to ignore it. Maybe all of us know that we are really aware of the pains of culture or history that are suppressed from learning that we cannot study just because we are not good at studying. And most importantly, the desire to study and doing well are distinctly different. I think the institution for high-level education is just a place for learning, but not a stadium which judges grades or students. Anyone who is eager to learn, their skills or abilities should not block their wishes to learn. Concluding, I claim that the education from college or university must be free for every students who has a passion for studying. Colleges and universities are aimed at academics, not evaluations, and should not be tolerated, even if there are differences in the speed of learning. I hope that every students who wants to learn about their interest should be given rights for study.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified because the essay presents a clear argument in favor of free higher education but lacks depth and specific examples to support its claims, such as failing to elaborate on how access to education can benefit society as a whole.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is warranted as the essay has a basic structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but it lacks clear transitions and logical flow between ideas, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument effectively.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate since the essay demonstrates a good command of English with some varied vocabulary and sentence structures, but contains grammatical errors like 'every students' instead of 'every student' that detract from its overall clarity."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.             \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nI believe that higher education should be available to limited amount of students. First, college doesn't ensure you a good education. Highly rated good universities may have good professors and good facilities to teach students, but when too many students go to university, there eventually exists some universities that doesn't have enough ability to teach students well. In those cases, college doesn't focus on teaching students, but only focus on earning money and make university rich instead. In worst case, when those university fail to bring students, they may go to bankrupt. In fact, in Korea, about 5 universities disappear a year because of this reason. Second, college may not give enough help for our life. Some jobs like blue-collar jobs doesn't require higher education. Of course most of students who goes to university may want white collar jobs or jobs that earn lot of money, but compared to good students, students of lower ability have pretty low chance of getting them. So when they go to college, they may waste 4 years for learning informations that wouldn't be probabilly used for whole life. Third, money is a huge issue too. Normal universities unlike KAIST offers great amount of money from their students. In US, it is a huge issue because lots of students have to spend their 20's to return money they've lent from bank for university. If most student goes to university, there will be lots of people in poverty who can't sustain to pay that money, and will cause social problem. In order to solve those problem, university need good scholarship system like KAIST, but if there are too many students, it is hard to provide those benefits to student. However if only good students go to university, we can easily construct those system and benefit good students. For these reasons, I think that there is no need for every students to go to university.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects a generally coherent argument, but the assertion that 'if only good students go to university, we can easily construct those system and benefit good students' lacks clarity and could be better supported with specific examples or data to strengthen the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 indicates that while the essay has a logical flow, the transition between points is sometimes abrupt, as seen when the author jumps from discussing the financial burdens of higher education to the need for a good scholarship system without clear connections.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is justified due to several grammatical errors, such as 'too many students go to university, there eventually exists some universities that doesn't have enough ability to teach students well,' where 'doesn't' should be 'don't,' demonstrating a lack of subject-verb agreement."}]}

There are two reasons below. First, Giving higher education to all students can be ineffective and unaffective. There must be some students who are not interested in studying and even who don't want to study. For those kinds of students, higher education might be meaningless. The asset used for making higher education available for all students can be used in more properly, for students who wants more education and students who doesn't want it. Secondly, it is very difficult to run the policy (higher education of all students). As you know, fee for unversity or college education is so expensive. Can the government pay all of the money for all students? If you think about a policy, making half the enrollment fee of colleges/universities, you can recognize that it is very difficult to run the policy. In short, I do not agree with higher education for all students. The first reason is ineffectiveness and unaffectiveness, and the second reason is that running the policy is difficult, there is little proability to run it. There must be other proper way to support and care all students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's limited exploration of the topic, as it presents only two reasons against universal higher education, such as the ineffectiveness for uninterested students and the financial challenges, without providing sufficient depth or supporting evidence for these claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the essay's clear structure with an introduction and conclusion, but it lacks effective transitions between points, particularly when moving from the first reason to the second, which makes the argument feel somewhat disjointed.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'there are two reasons below' and 'there is little proability to run it,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

The goal of the college or university education is promoting and raising skilled experts to improve and develop our society. To do that, it cost a lot of money. Even if we afford all student, it's obvious most of them won't be able to reach the degree that the society want, so waste of money and time occur when the college or university education is available for any students. Second, it promotes students to think about their future. Because there are certain condition or details to get certain education, individual students should think about what they are good at, and what they love to do. It helps students to know about themselves better, which is establishment of solid and constructive ego.

So if we gave everybody a chance to get university education, most people would stop trying and it would be harmful to the ones who studied hard. If we allow everyone to get college education no matter their behavior, people wouldn't try hard thinking they can learn later on and stop studying hard. Nowadays, students study for university, but if we remove this purpose, students won't study. This will lead to society become foolish. Opening university to everyone is also a problem for those who studied hard. As anyone can attend to class, the atmosphere of the class will become bad and the quality will be also downgraded.

Various countries still invest massive amount of money on space industry; for example, U.S. spent 10 billion dollars for exploring outer space on 2020. (ref I) Despite the opinion that the budget for exploring outer space is a waste of money, governments should keep investing on space industry for two reasons.\nFirst of all, the space industry leads the frontline of the technologies. The technology for exploring outer space has widely applied to daily life. According to (ref II), it is suggested that various daily products are based on space technologies: example 1, 2, 3. By allocating the budget for outer space, the life on Earth can be improved efficiently.\nIn addition to advanced technology, the space industry enables alternative dwelling options for future. Total population has increased exponentially, and it is reported to exceed 500,000,000 in ten years. (ref III) Outer space can be good alternatives for Earth to afford massive populations; for example, Mars are planned to be developed for future residence in SpaceX. (ref IV)\nAlthough the space industry gives various benefits, some argues that the space industry is waste of money. \nIn conclusion, the governments spend plenty of money on space industry to improve the life in present and future. The technologies in space industry are not only useful for outer space, but also necessary for daily life. The investment of governments should be increased gradually to lead the technology.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects the essay's strength in presenting the importance of space industry investment, but it lacks specific examples of daily products derived from space technologies, as seen in the vague reference to 'example 1, 2, 3.'\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, including a logical flow from the introduction to the conclusion, but the transition between discussing technology and population issues could be smoother to enhance coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is supported by the mostly clear and articulate expression, though it contains grammatical errors such as 'some argues' instead of 'some argue,' which detracts from the overall quality of the writing."}]}

In the past, the United States and the Soviet Union fought their own wars by who conquered the universe first, so the Soviet Union created the first satellite and the United States created the first moon exploration. People all over the world cheered for human advancement into space and created their imagination like various sci-fi films and books. Just as movies like 'Martian', 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' depict humanity living in space, they constantly that desire to go into space; however, there are some argue that why they should explore space. Nevertheless, in my opinion, exploring space helps the entire human beings for three reasons.\nFirst of all, the Earth is increasingly losing its function as a home for life, and people needs a new place for humanity to live. Rapidly growing of Human beings, reckless resource development and natural destruction make the Earth die. The Amazon forest, which is called Earth's lungs and produces fresh oxygen, has destroyed much of it and is still being cut down. Climate change is happening all over the world, and the climate that we've adapted to is changing, so it's a big mess in people's farming. Exploring the universe is expanding human habitation. An extraterrestrial asteroid has abundant mineral resources, and an extraterrestrial planet with water and oxygen. NASA plans to set up manned space bases on Mars and the moon, and humans will have a place of residence where they can escape in the event of a major disaster on Earth.\nFurthermore, exploring space is the greatest preparation to prevent the extinction of mankind. Just a few months ago, a big asteroid hit the Earth. There are hundreds of millions of asteroids in the universe. It is smaller than the Earth or the moon, and travels through space. The larger the planet, the greater its gravity, which in other words attracts objects around it. If there is an asteroid that passes around the Earth, the Earth will pull it in and if it is large enough, the Earth will be shocked and even destroyed. We need to develop enough technology to explore the universe to prevent this destruction of humanity.\nSome argue that space exploration costs too much, despite that opinion, it makes money. Among the technologies developed by NASA for space exploration, there are many things that make up a big part of our lives. In particular, computers were first developed for space exploration, and fabrics used in space suits brought about the development of clothing. So this has resulted in the same amount of money that we spent on space exploration.\nIn conclusion, human space exploration is essential for the human race's big leap forward. It is also to prevent the earth from being devastated and to prevent mankind from becoming extinct. We have to explore the universe at all costs.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified by the essay's strong argument for space exploration, particularly in the discussion of Earth's diminishing resources, as seen in the example about the Amazon rainforest being cut down, although it could benefit from more detailed evidence or examples to bolster its claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct paragraphs for each argument, such as the transition from the need for new habitats to the prevention of extinction, though some transitions between ideas could be smoother.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted due to the effective use of vocabulary and sentence variety, as in the phrase 'the greatest preparation to prevent the extinction of mankind', but there are several grammatical errors, such as 'people needs' instead of 'people need', which detract from the overall clarity."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.        \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nThe outer space is expected to include unknown scientific facts and various resources for our life. That is the reason that the worlds focus on exploring technologies which needs a lot of money. The money usually comes from government to enhance their technology; however, several aspects shows that the government should invest more money on daily than exploring outer space. \nFirst of all, governments manage too much things to invest specific technology. For instance, they control supporting money for COVID19, the over expansion of house price, and the rights for everything that we face on. In fact, the government increase their investing money for supporting money as 57% for their citizens in Seoul (Lee). It obviously shows that they do not have any resources to invest for exploring outer space. \nThe second aspect is about the private subjects of investigators that decrease the responsibility of government investigation. In now day, private investigators become common to find on every fields. For example, the money from private investigators increases as 16% on space technology than last year, and the invested field of same technology becomes 11% larger than just 6 months (Hoffman). Also, there was amazing news about success of launching the rocket of private subjects. Two evidence shows that they are enough to investigate, so the government is not only the main subject but also privates are.\nSome people argue that the government can enhance the efficiency of research, but it is not true. According to Research Lab, they shows the result that the project from government had less efficiency on economic factors as 25% (Kim). The fact shows that they participate non effective researches, so they should not decrease efficiency.\nThe government do not have to investigate specific technology. What they should do is to encourage private subjects, and manage daily things, and do not participate much on non effective researches. This is the mandatory to enhance both our life and technology.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified by the essay's clear argument against government funding for space exploration, as evidenced by the mention of private investigators increasing investment in space technology, which demonstrates an understanding of alternative funding sources; however, the argument could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples of how daily investments can directly impact citizens' lives.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is warranted because the essay presents a logical flow of ideas with distinct paragraphs for each argument, yet it lacks smooth transitions between points, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing government responsibilities to private investment without adequate linking phrases.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the essay's generally clear expression of ideas, but is hindered by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'the worlds focus on exploring technologies which needs a lot of money,' which detracts from the overall clarity of the argument."}]}

Countries are responsible of many things for their public such as education, health, and transportation. Some think that governments should spend as much money as possible exploring other planets. Other disagree and believe that governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. In my opinion, it is better for governments to spend this money for the public without exploring outer space for several reasons.\nFirst of all, governments have a duty to protect the health of its people. Despite the advances in medical technology, many people died because infections, cancer, and other new diseases. Therefore, the government should pay attention about patients and medical insurance or environment.  COVID 19, a global epidemic, is an example of this. A report by 'The Korea News' said that South Korea covered all medical expenses for the public in Corona crisis. Like this, governments are interest in health care for their people always.\nThe second reason is that governments should make their people live more comfortably. The people who live in a country said their inconvenience in their lives like transportation, house, or taxes to the government. Governments should divide their budget properly to various national policies.\nMany argue that exploring outer space is needed to abandon the polluted earth and find a new place to live; however, governments should prevent the contamination of the earth.\nTo sum up, government should try to use their budget for the people on earth.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified because while the essay presents valid points regarding the importance of prioritizing health and basic needs, it lacks depth in supporting arguments, such as not elaborating on how governments can effectively allocate their budgets for health care and infrastructure improvements.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted as the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but it could improve transitions between ideas, as seen in the abrupt shift from health care to addressing comfort in living conditions.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate since the essay generally uses clear language and varied vocabulary, yet it contains grammatical errors, such as 'governments are interest in health care' instead of 'governments are interested in health care,' which detracts from the overall clarity."}]}

Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.        \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nRecently, a debate regarding whether governments should spend money for exploring outer space or for our basic needs on Earth has been brought upon. Some claims that exploring the other planets can be helpful to our descendant, and the others emphasize the lack of our basic needs on Earth. While a large population may assert that discovering the unknown space can solve the uncertainties of future, such notion should be highly reconsidered. Without doubt, investing capital to our Earth have essential benefits. \nFirst, protecting the Earth's environment should be a priority. The basic needs of mankind come from nature, and humanity has ruined the natural environment too much. For example, too many glaciers in the Arctic are destroyed, and the Amazon rain forest has burned too much. Therefore, these destruction led to the inability to obtain basic needs.\nWhat is more compelling is that government financial support can save citizens. Money is necessary for life because the fundamental needs can be earned by the money. For instance, citizens in developing countries are not able to buy even basic drinking water and food shortages. \nSome argue that the future uncertainties can be overcome by finding new resources in outer space. This contention is based on high probabilities of success. To rebut opponents\u2019 claim, discovering new resources outside the Earth is a very rare probability and has never been successful.

Accordingly, capital should be invested for our basic needs of Earth in terms of probability.\nTo sum up, these advantages suggest using capital for basic needs of mankind is needed.

They have lunched lots of space ships and have sent lots of people to outer space. Although some people say that governments should spend the money for our basic needs on Earth instead of exploring outer space, governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space for several reasons.\nFirst of all, materials are limited on Earth. Until now, human used lots of materials, such as steel, gasoline, etc. Because of limitation, there will be no materials to use in future. For example, oil is one of the most significant fuel on Earth. People have used tremendous oil for development and convenience, and the estimated amount of oil is not much remained on Earth. Unless people find out other replacement of oil on Earth, exploring outer space is inevitable.\nThe second reason is a land. Thanks to improvement of technologies, population have rapidly increased; therefore, human will lack of a living land in future. \neconomy\nTo sum up, because of materials, land and economy, government should encourage to explore outer space. There will be many unknown things outer space, so that things will be a solutions of many problem on Earth.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a relevant argument for space exploration, but it lacks depth and specificity, particularly in the second reason where the statement about population growth and land is vague and poorly developed.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay has a clear introductory statement and a concluding summary, but it suffers from a lack of coherent transitions between ideas, especially between the first and second reasons presented.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the essay's generally clear expression, but it contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'human used lots of materials' instead of 'humans have used many materials,' which detracts from its clarity."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.        \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nFocus on Our Planet, The Earth\n\nExploring outer space such as traveling to the Moon and to other planets have been funded and made some progress in history. There are two side of view among people; some say the governments in the world should keep investing in this space traveling, but others say the Earth problem is more urgent for wasting money on space research. In my opinion, the governments have to focus on the issues happening in our planet for following three reasons.\nFirst, it is skeptical that the governments will make profit or find a possibility of space development. There have been a bunch of historical researches on the space, and many astronauts have been to the Moon, also many small space probes have been sent to the space. Despite the endeavors to find something in the space, the scientists rather found there is nothing special in the Sun system. Furthermore, even if we try to go to another system of planets, or out of the Sun system, it is found that exiting the Sun system takes more than 20 years. Who would travel that far distance sacrificing one's whole life?\nIn addition, instead of investing in space traveling, we need to focus more on the Earth crisis. we don't have enough time and money just to deal with the Earth problems. Look at how many people are still in hunger, how many cities are in inequality. The human crisis and environmental crisis must be the first to tackle. Human will end up keeping living on the Earth, so the governments need to solve the global warming, giving money to sustainable energy research programs.\nSome might say that the governments should spend money on the space just for academic purpose; However, it is not desirable to spend public resources on academic hunger of few people. In addition, the human has achieved remarkable knowledge in the past decades; in other words, there is few thing left human can easily find with less money because human already know most of principles in the Universe. Human have already sent telescope, probes in the space, and more than ten people have been to the Moon. The governments have to think about the efficiency of a new project on the space.\nIt is clear that spending money on the space is not desirable than focusing on dealing with the Earth issues. A new space project is unlikely to give us new achievements, and there are many Earth crisis which is ongoing and urgent. Space investments have been enough, and the governments faced a clear limit to the hope of finding something in the space. It is time to focus more on the current issues in our living ground; human will eventually ended up staying on the Earth.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 14.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 5.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear and well-supported argument regarding the need to prioritize Earth issues over space exploration, exemplified by the mention of pressing problems like hunger and inequality, which strengthens the overall message.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted, as the essay has a logical structure with distinct points, but the transition between ideas could be improved, particularly in the shift from discussing space exploration to addressing Earth's problems, which feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 reflects a strong command of English, though there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as 'there are two side of view' and 'human will eventually ended up staying,' which detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Eventually, humanity could reach the moon, but no one has ever gone to the moon since more than 20 years ago. Even related budgets are being cut a lot. This is because exploring outer space is not very helpful to human. There are two reasons for spending this money for our basic needs on Earth.\nFirst of all, exploring outer space requires a great deal of money, but the benefits of this are not clear. What people can get right now through space exploration is just scientific progress. Some claim that these advances can bring resources from space or move to new planets outside of Earth, so it is worth spending a lot of money. However, people don't know how much it will benefit, or even whether it can be realized. Everything about space exploration is just a probability. Rather than space exploration, people should focus on solving many problems that human needs to be solve; plague, war, hunger poverty and climate change.\nThe next reason is that human has not yet fully grasped the Earth. For example, people have said that oil will run out soon after decades ago. However, the advances in technology have uncovered new oil fields and found alternatives such as oil sands; therefore, oil is still abundant and reserves are unpredictable. In addition, people do not know the sea too. Most of the Earth's deep sea is completely unknown. Recently, people use submarines for exploring deep sea, so can get information little by little. There are a lot of things people need to know about the Earth to look out.\nTo sum it up, space exploration is expensive and the benefits are unclear. Instead, focusing on the Earth will still have some unknown places to explore and help solve many of human's problems. This will rather serve as a stepping stone for future space exploration, resulting in better results.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents strong arguments against space exploration, such as the statement that 'exploring outer space requires a great deal of money, but the benefits of this are not clear,' although it could benefit from more specific examples of the problems on Earth that need attention.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted as the essay effectively presents its arguments in a logical sequence, with a clear progression from the introduction to the conclusion, yet the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly when shifting from the discussion of space exploration to Earth's issues.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate as the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and syntax, but it contains some grammatical errors, such as 'human has not yet fully grasped the Earth,' which should be 'humans have not yet fully grasped the Earth.'"}]}

Basically, science fiction is based on scientific facts, but it also contains some scientific errors. Some scientists believe that wrong scientific knowledge, which is widely spread, is because of science fiction. For example, many people believe that there are many minerals or resources to use in outer space; that's not true. Government should spend money for our basic needs on Earth rather than space exploration with two reasons.\n  First of all, using resources in outer space is inefficient. NASA or other organizations found some planets which have resources. However, according to NASA, it takes over thousands year to reach, even the speed of spaceship reaches to light. Even they found other planets within easy distance, the cost for movement and collection in outer space is more expensive than on Earth. There is no economic benefit to go outer space.\nNext, space is mostly unknown and dangerous. There are many harms that we already know: thin air, strong ultraviolet rays, black holes, and so on. Even discoveries accompany sacrifices, that can be useless death. Also, research for the space are unclear before they confirm the appearance through their own eyes. Investment to those uncertain development is wrong.\nSome people said that development of  space technology would make the exploration more efficient. However, there is a limitation. According to Einstein, every materials' speed is limited until the speed of light. Therefore, we cannot make any spaceships that can move over the light speed, which means time for migration between outer planet will not decrease dramatically.\nTo sum up, development of outer space technology is inefficient and uncertain. On the other hand, it's possible to solve the poverty and cure the incurable illnesses by using that budget. There are many other unsolved problems on Earth. Humankind should solve these problems before the development of outer space. It might be more helpful to humankind.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay presents a clear argument against space exploration, citing that 'using resources in outer space is inefficient' as a strength; however, it lacks depth in exploring alternative viewpoints or counterarguments, which weakens the overall content score.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is logically organized with a clear introduction and conclusion, but the transition between the second and third paragraphs could be improved, as the shift from discussing dangers of space to limitations of technology feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language used in the essay is generally clear, but there are grammatical errors such as 'every materials' speed is limited,' which reduces the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

However, governments should invest in exploring outer space including making another planet the colony and gathering resources. There are three apparent reasons why governments should do such works.\nFirst of all, the earth is a restricted planet. Even if there are enough resources that 7 billion people can use now, it will not be the case in the future. Futurists say that the population will keep growing. If it comes to be true, the lack of resources will call a disaster. In the movie; The Avengers, Thanos has a mission to eliminate 50% of the population since he saw how lack of resources called the disaster on his planet, Titan. If people do not invest in outer space, the story in the movie will come true.\nThe next reason is the historical fact that humans had developed so far doing researches. Everyone blamed the person who invented cars. No one tried to use expensive and heavy cars while there are horses. However, the invention of the car changed the world. If people hesitate to invest in a larger area, it will be the end of human development history. Even if it is scary to invest money in a mystery place, it will return more than invested money.\nA number of people think that investing money in outer space is useless. However, this is not true. There are too many things that made life better since there was an investment in outer space. For example, GPS can be possible since there is 24 satellite in outer space. It might seem like investing billion dollars to rockets are insane. However, if there was no investment in a rocket, there will be no GPS and navigation that made a number of things possible including saving people with location tracking. \nIn conclusion, there are obvious reasons why governments should invest in outer space: limited resources, to develop, and application. People have to see further to make humans great. If they only try to seek short happiness, the only thing that waits for them is a long depression.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents relevant arguments for investing in outer space, such as population growth and technological advancements, but it lacks depth in some explanations, particularly in the point about the historical development of the car, which could have been more clearly articulated.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 reflects a generally logical structure with clear topic sentences for each paragraph; however, the transition from discussing population issues to the historical context of car innovation feels abrupt and could be smoothed out for better flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is supported by the use of varied vocabulary and mostly correct grammar, but the phrase 'there are too many things that made life better since there was an investment in outer space' is slightly awkward and could be more clearly expressed."}]}

It was successful for recent days; humans can go to the moon and other planets, and they come back to Earth safely. Furthermore, it looks possible to use the area of the planets and sources of them. However, to access that stage, more money is needed for research and there is a debate whether using much more money to exploring outer space is right or not. Some says that exploring planets is the hope of the Earth, but it looks irrational. The money should be used for people on Earth now.\nOne reason is that no one cannot assure the success of this project. No one knows about the environment and sources of the planet exactly. If the project fails by unexpected factors, then who can recover the money? It will be the responsibility of the people in Earth; moreover, no one knows if it can be recovered. Money for exploring planets is not small one to gamble, so it is desirable to use them to the Earth.\nAnother reason is that there exists so many people in need. Those people is now living so hard and waiting for help. Poorly, they cannot eat sufficient food and drink water; also, people in disease cannot be treated because they don't have enough sources. There is no strong reason to ignore them and research for the planter. While the research is ongoing, most of them will die. Therefore, rather than looking for distant planets, taking care of neighborhoods would be more urgent.\nSome says that the life of the Earth is not long enough, but it is not true. Supporters for exploring planets insists the short life of Earth for the climate other signals of the Earth that can be seen in normal days. It looks serious, but it is the consequence of humans: factory, artificial ingredients, trash etc. It can be seen that the atmosphere changes one the factory stops for few days. Therefore, the signal for short life can disappear by stopping some factories and other pollutants. \nThere is no doubt that the people in Earth now are more important than the exploring the planets in future with unknown possibility. To regret, there have been minimal efforts to saving the Earth in governments; thus, the effort for saving Earth and the people in Earth should be the first assignment. Exploring the planets would be the next.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's strong argument against space exploration, particularly through the point that 'there exists so many people in need,' but it lacks depth in providing specific examples or data to support the claims about poverty and health issues on Earth.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents clear arguments in separate paragraphs, but the flow is hindered by awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing funding issues to the urgency of addressing poverty.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted as the essay demonstrates a good command of language, yet it contains grammatical errors like 'no one cannot assure the success' and 'those people is now living so hard,' which detract from clarity and professionalism."}]}

And now, humanity is going on a outer space exploration. The Soviet Union was the first in the world to travel to space, and the United States was the first to land on the moon. However, some people say that spending money for basic needs on Earth is more important than exploring outer space.The debate continues, but exploring outer space should be continued for these three main reasons.\nFirst of all, there are not many resources left on Earth. During the long period of human living, resources have been used continuously, so there are not enough resources left on Earth. Because the lack of resources is coming, human must replenish resources from outer space.\nIn addition to lack of resources, population growth is also a problem. In modern times, the population is exploding, so the earth is narrowing; people do not have enough space to live. In order to get a space to live comfortably, exploring outer space is necessary.\nOpposites say that exploring outer space is too early, and there are much time to prepare the problems like lack of resources and population growth. However, exploring outer space is high technology, so to complete the exploring outer space, scientists and engineers need enormous time and money. Because of that,  exploring outer space should be continued.\nTo sum up, exploring outer space must keep going for human's future. Many problems remain with humanity, such as lack of resources and population growth. Human need much time and money to solve these problems. To solve these problems, human should explore outer space.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects a strong argument for space exploration, but it could be improved by providing more specific examples of resources that could be obtained from outer space, as the argument currently lacks depth.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, but the transition between points is somewhat abrupt, especially when moving from discussing resource depletion to population growth, which could be better linked.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate due to several grammatical errors, such as 'a outer space exploration' instead of 'an outer space exploration,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Also, naturally, the curiosity about whether if there is a planet to live or not in the space is going up. Consequently, some people think that spending money to explore the space is strongly needed for us. However, in my opinion, I think the government should spend less money in near future and spend more to people.\nFirst of all, finding new planet is not too urgent issue now. People might need to find new place to live outside of earth in the future; but these days, it is not necessary yet. Even though some people are urging about the lack of resources, the earth still has a lot yet: such as coal, water, and food. Thus, exploring the space to find new territory is too early to consider.\nMoreover, there are a lot of problems to solve currently. Recently, the virus named COVID-19 has spread over the earth, and numerous of people are dying even now. Also, there was a nuclear issue in all over the world. These kind of problems are hard to solve; but, they are the thumbs of the problem which the governments take care. Therefore, exploring space must not be the first to the government. \nLast but not least, too much money is required to explore in space. In spite of the statements above, the exploration to the space is needed for the improvement of science. However, they need a huge amount of money in general. Thus, it is not too late if the government try to explore the space when they have sufficient money.\nTo sum up, to explore the space is not too urgent issue, and instead, there are some problems to the earth to solve now. Add, the amount of money to explore the space is too much for the countries now. It is also the important to find new planets and to study the space, but there are a lot of problems to focus on. By these reasons, the government should use the money to the earth.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's clear argument against space exploration funding, but it is weakened by the lack of detailed evidence or examples, such as specific statistics or studies on resource availability on Earth, to support the claim that exploring space is not urgent.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the logical progression of ideas; however, the essay suffers from a lack of clear transitions between paragraphs, making it difficult for the reader to follow the flow of arguments, especially between discussing current issues and the urgency of space exploration.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate due to the generally clear expression of ideas, but it is diminished by grammatical errors such as 'the \uc5f4\uc815 of people' and awkward phrasing like 'the thumbs of the problem,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

To progress this project, there a lot of money is needed; besides, governments only can support money. Spending as much money as possible exploring outer space is necessary and there are three main reasons. \nFirst, the result of research about outer space will be precious property to the country. In the past, people could not think people can talk with people who leave far; however, now people can do this through science development. Science technology becomes an important resource for the country now. Just like this, in the future, technology about going to the other planets or moon may be strong points to the country, and that country may be a strong country in the world. \nSecond, there is an honor to the country that makes the first result of space. These days all of the students in the world learn that American people went to the moon for the first time. Many media such as movie and books says about this. Like this, if one country success to go to the other planet in the future, all of the people in the world know about this. This is honor to the country and this honor will be a strong point to the economy and society because of the global period.\nOther people can think governments can save their country a person with this money. However, if governments think the present only, that country will go to the behind other countries. Technology about another planet is a high technology and this will be competitiveness with the country. The country will be hard when only other countries get high technology because they have to pay to get learn their thechnology.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects a solid understanding of the importance of space exploration, but the argument is weakened by vague statements such as 'there a lot of money is needed' which lacks specificity and clarity regarding the financial requirements.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay with an introduction and three main points, but the transition between ideas could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing technological advancements to national honor without a smooth connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate given the essay's generally clear expression, but it suffers from grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'goes to the moon for the first time' instead of 'went to the moon for the first time' and 'that country will go to the behind other countries,' which detracts from overall readability."}]}

They can support infrastructure like roads and highways, or they can support public transportation like buses, trains, and subways. In my opinion, governments should improve public transportation for three main reasons.\nFirst of all, public transportation makes less environmental pollution. Improving infrastructure causes increasing private transportation; therefore, harmful gas is increasing in air. This gas can make critical pollution to environment. On the other hand, increasing public transportation makes less harmful gas. It will be good for environment.\nIn addition to environment, public transportation is economical. One public transportation can transport lots of people. In this case, less amount of money should be needed to resolve traffic problem. Moreover, even though increasing roads or highways is hard to construct, public transportation can be easily increased. Thus, public transportation saves more money.\nSome argue that improving infrastructure is efficient way to resolve traffic problem. They say increasing roads or highways makes much more traffic capacity. However, since territory is limited, improving infrastructure also has limit. Public transportation can be increased continuously without regarding limit of territory. That is, public transportation is efficient way to increase traffic capacity.\nTo sum up, public transportation has three strengths: environment, economics, and efficiency. Of course, governments should spend money on both infrastructure and public transportation. However, if governments' money is limited, improving public transportation should be a priority.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively presents three main reasons supporting public transportation, such as its positive impact on the environment and economic benefits, but it lacks depth in explaining these points, particularly the environmental argument which could benefit from more specific examples or evidence.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is well-organized with clear transitions between points, as seen in the use of phrases like 'First of all' and 'In addition to environment,' yet it could improve by providing a more robust introduction and conclusion to frame the argument more effectively.\nJustification for Language: While the language is mostly clear, the essay contains awkward phrasing, such as 'makes less harmful gas' which could be better articulated as 'produces fewer harmful emissions,' indicating a need for more precise language usage."}]}

For example, the government improving highways, subways and buses with money which collected from people. This development provides transportation services to the people. Should the government spend more money on roads or public transportation? The government has to spend more money on public transportation development for two main reason.\nFirst of all, the development of public transportation is more environmentally friendly than the development of roads and highways. Development of roads and highways is, after all, an encouragement of personal use of the car. When the same number of people in one area move to another area, using public transportation consumes less energy than when they use their own car. In particular, car fumes is an important factor in environmental pollution. \nSecondly, there is a difference in the number of people who benefit from development. Only people with private vehicles benefit from road and highway development. However, public transportation can be used by people who do not have their own vehicles. Therefore, the government should focus on the development of public transportation so as not to discriminate people according to they have or have not vehicles.\nOn the other hands,  there is a argue that public transportation has no economic advantage than highways. However, the development of public transportation has cultural advantage because it provides transportation services to many people.\nTo sum up, there are two reason public transportation development is more better. One reason is for environmental, the other reason is that many people can benefit. Therefore the government should focus and spend more money on improving public transportation.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for prioritizing public transportation development, but it lacks depth in supporting arguments, such as not sufficiently elaborating on the cultural advantages mentioned in the third paragraph.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate because the essay generally follows a logical structure with a clear introduction and conclusion, but it could be improved by better transitioning between ideas, as seen in the abrupt shift between the second and third paragraphs.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the essay's generally clear expression, yet it contains several grammatical errors, such as 'there is a argue' which should be 'there is an argument,' indicating a need for more careful proofreading."}]}

The Korea is also facing the same problem. Especially, metropolises like Seoul and Busan are always criticized the claim. Thus, some argue that the Korean governments should spend more money on improving public transportation for a solution about the problem; however, in my opinion, more important direction of solution is increasing budget to improve roads and highways for two reasons: the roads of the large cities already full and tendency of the Korean do not head public transportation.\nFirst, The roads, include highway, already fully filled by cars. Usually, the cause of the Korean transportation problem is traffic. Because the people normally take more than one car per one family, not only big cities, but also highway and other cities has traffic problem. In fact, the main highway that links Seoul and Busan easily shows heavy traffics. So, what the government should do is expanding capacity, not increasing number of new public transportation. \nSome argue that the increased individual transportation should be suppressed and increasing of using public transportation is required; however, public transportation cannot replace their own car. The public transportation should drive to follow specific time line and selected course. In this condition, it is hard to move appropriately when the emergency happens. For example, someone hurts, and the time for waiting 911 is not enough, public transportation cannot answer the question. Needs of own car is strongly demanded, and it is hard to replace. \nTo sum up, the Korean massive transportation problem needs to be solved soon with expanding roads,\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for improving roads over public transportation, but it lacks depth in supporting details, such as not providing specific statistics or studies to strengthen the claim about the traffic problems in Korean cities.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, yet it suffers from some abrupt transitions, particularly between the first and second paragraphs where the shift to discussing public transportation could be smoother.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted due to some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'the roads of the large cities already full' which should be 'the roads in large cities are already full', indicating a need for improved language accuracy and clarity."}]}

People tend to like the cities because the cities have more infra than the countryside. This phenomena is noticeable for the big cities; for example, Seoul, New York, and Beijing are complicated. Therefore, the traffic problems are appearing in those countries which have big cities, and there is two big different views. Although some say governments should spend more money on the roads and highways, I would say public transportation is more important in terms of three points.\nFirst of all, the population is growing in world-wide. Human beings have improved agriculture methods and medical knowledges, and this makes the population pop-up from the 100 million to the 700 million. Increasing so fast, human beings are gathering up together and make the big city. The city with a huge population have also a big area, so people needs transportation to move on. Therefore, the government should build more public transportation to solve this.\nThe following reason for the population problem is traffic problem. In these days, almost every families have their own cars. Without the public transportations, they definitely ride their vehicles when they are going shopping or going to work. This induces a terrible traffic jam during every morning and evening. However, If there are enough public transports, less cars go out to the roads and less traffic jam will be happened.\nThe opponents will insist that building more roads can solve those problems, but it is not. To increase the amount of the roads and highways, some space will be needed. However, the big cities have already too much roads and buildings to make more roads and highways. Building more roads in these cities should contain destruction of buildings or expanding the city, and this makes just more complicated city and traffic jam. On the other hand, improving public transportation does not need any expansion. Thus, more effective and economical.\nTo summarize, governments should spend money on improving public transport. Three reasons are given for this, even if some says roads and highways are more important. Improving public transport is necessary in terms of population, traffic, and spacing, and this will improve the city life, too.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for the importance of public transportation, supported by relevant points such as the need for transportation due to population growth; however, the claim that the population increased from 100 million to 700 million is inaccurate and undermines the argument's credibility.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is supported by the logical structure of the essay, which includes a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on specific reasons, and a summarizing conclusion; however, the transition between some points could be smoother to enhance coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 reflects the generally clear and understandable writing style, but instances of grammatical errors, such as 'the cities have more infra than the countryside,' detract from the overall quality and precision of expression."}]}

One of the ways is to improve the quality of transportation. In my opinion, spending more money on improving public transportation is more important than roads and highways.\nTo begin with, environmental problems are a more urgent concern than developing the roads. People are indeed living in a society where environmental pollution is getting more serious. As pollution is growing fast, the number of cars is exponentially increasing as well followed by an increase in methane gas from them. Car exhaust gas causes air pollution, and it is rising as a critical problem today. To resolve this problem governments should slightly improve public transportation to encourage people to save the world and address the seriousness of air pollution.\nSecondly, it is possible for economic growth to be active. When public transportation is more activated, economic benefits are increased not only for individuals but also for the nation. In the case of public transportation, some of the profits are included as taxes used by the public in the transportation sector, so the more it is used, the more improvement it will make in the transportation sector. Moreover, public transportation costs little. For example, the maintenance fee for things such as engine replacement, fuel charging, tire replacement is high compared to public transportation prices. Thus, it is better to improve public transportation.\nSome people argue that improving roads and highways can have a greater effect on traffic jams than improving public transportation, and it will cost less in the long run. However, traffic congestion in crowded places is not solved in the first place because of the high density of the roads in Korea. Besides, there is no more room for road expansion in this high-density country. Since Korea is already developed as much it could, it is better to develop public transportation to increase efficiency on existing roads than to expand roads.\nIn conclusion,  the government should spend money on improving public transportation rather than road and highways. It helps boost the economy as it consumes money in the transportation market and better for our environment.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 5.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 14.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 5.0 is justified as the essay effectively discusses the importance of improving public transportation over roads, providing relevant examples such as the environmental impact of car exhaust and economic benefits tied to public transit usage.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 5.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear and logical flow of ideas, with each paragraph addressing a specific point, such as the environmental concerns in the first paragraph followed by economic arguments in the second.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is justified due to some awkward phrasing and grammatical errors, such as 'slightly improve public transportation' which could be more compellingly expressed as 'significantly enhance public transportation'."}]}

Although many think that using public transportation is quite uncomfortable to transfer and physically hard, it has many individual and public advantages. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation for three reasons in different aspects: convenience, environment, and cost.\nNowadays, public transportation is widely used for a long distance like Seoul to Pusan. In this case, using public transportation is more convenient than cars, because people don\u2019t need to concentrate on their driving and ride comfort is not bad. For example, some college students like KAIST students use trains a lot to go dormitory. If parents drive Seoul to Daejeon with their car, parents will get tired after their driving. Rather than using a car, if students use express bus or train, they can save a time and feel more comfortable. \nSecond, public transportation is more eco-friendly than cars. If all citizens use their individual cars every day, a lot of carbon dioxide occurs in the air. This carbon dioxide would cause green gases which increase the temperature globally. However, if all of them use subways at once, it could save the clean air from air pollution. Furthermore, some transportations work by electric energy, so they don\u2019t release any polluted gas. \nOn the other hand, some argue that the public transportation is quite expensive. However, there are lots of events to discount the transportation expenses; for example, traveling with four friends in KTX can halve the KTX fee. Not only the transportations with a long distance, but also subways have some great discount system in Korea. If the user transfers to another subway track, it just cost a little additional pay to travel a long distance. Plus, car also pays a lot of money on oil charging, so using car is not much economically beneficial than public transportation.\nIn conclusion, spend more money on public transportation is much more beneficial than roads and highways. Some argue that it is financial damage, but its convenience, environmentally positive effect, and discount of cost cover all disadvantages with additional benefits. There will be more advanced public transportations created that many enjoy them to get in workplace or travel.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay effectively presents three clear reasons for why governments should invest in public transportation; however, it could be strengthened by providing more specific statistical evidence or examples, such as data on the environmental impact of public transportation versus cars.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is appropriate as the essay follows a logical structure with clear topic sentences for each paragraph, but the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly when moving from the environmental impact to the cost argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 reflects the overall clarity and coherence of the writing, though there are instances of awkward phrasing, such as 'spend more money on public transportation is much more beneficial' which should be corrected to 'spending more money on public transportation is much more beneficial.'"}]}

Therefore, governments from various countries concern about spending money to improve roads and highways, or public transportation. In my opinion, improving public transportation is better than improving roads and highways for several reasons.\nFirst of all, improving public transportation is more environmental-friendly. Improving roads and highways would increase personal car drivers, which is one of the causes of pollution; on the other hand, improving public vehicles would make people to choose them rather than their own cars. To maintain clean environments with convenience, spending money to improve public transportation is the best way.\nSecond, improving public transportation costs less than improving roads and highways. To improve roads and highways, the government need to find out less efficient roads, destroy them, and make new one; however, to improve public transportation, they just need to increase the number of them, or change the line of them. It need far less money and time for latter one, which means more economical.\nSome people may think that improving roads and highways would give more conveniences than public vehicles; although it would make people with their own cars more convenient at first, improving roads and highways would give people more traffics on the roads. According to research from KAIST, there was more accidents and traffic problems with wide roads(Jeon 32). On the other hand, lots of public transportation would distribute car drivers to them, and it will decrease traffic problems.\nTo sum up, improving public transportation is more environmental-friendly, costs less, and gives more conveniences while going out. Since the governments should choose better one in the limited budget, improving public transportation would be the best choice for their citizens.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay clearly presents strong arguments for improving public transportation, such as being more environmentally friendly and cost-effective, though it could strengthen its position by providing more specific data or examples to support its claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted because the essay follows a logical structure with clear introductory and concluding paragraphs, but it could improve transitions between points for smoother flow, particularly between the second and third arguments.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate as the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and sentence structure, yet it contains some grammatical errors, such as 'the government need' instead of 'the government needs,' which detracts from the overall clarity."}]}

Both transportations help our live in different way. However, if the government budget is limited, in my opinion, an investment in public transportation should be preceded. There are three reasons why government should spend money on improving the public transportation; reduce of transport congestion, less destruction of environment, and reduce of environmental pollution.\nFirst of all, developing a public transportation reduces transport congestion. According to Kim, who researches about Korean transportation and transport congestion, using bus and underground reduces transport congestion more than 25%. We should consider the fact that the population density is exponentially increasing(Anderson), and capacitance of people in public transportation is much better than a car(Kim). Indeed, Following the researches about transportation and population, we can easily think that public transportation is better way in reducing transport congestion in high population density.\nSecond, developing public transportation makes less destruction of environment. Korea has a lot of mountains and the land is usually not flat enough to make highway(Lee). Therefore, environment such as mountains are easily destroyed to construct highways and road. In contrast, developing public transportation usually happens inside or near the city, so it derives to less destruction of environment. Accordingly, the animals live in that environment could be safer, too.\nApart from the advantages related with transportation, improving public transportation is better in protecting environment. Public transportation uses less energy than a car, and also emits less pollution maters than a car. If we consider the future transportation with less pollution, we should invest in public transportation than other ones.\nTo sum up, despite the convenience of a road and highways, we should develop a public transportation. It will be the way to reduce pollution, environment destruction, and also the congestion. At the end, the government should invest in public transpotation.\n\nKim, Elvis, \u201cAbout tranportaion history.\u201d Editorial. The New York Times. 29 Sep. 2012: A-22.

Some people argue that governments should spend more money on improving roads and highways; however, in my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation.\nFirst of all, expanding public transportation is far more effective in improving traffic systems. Nowadays, a number of people prefer public transportation since they cannot afford to buy a car or owning car is not suitable for their purpose. For this reason, enhancing public transit brings great effect if it is fully settled down. \nIn addition, constructing public transportation is good for the environment. Buses, trains, and subways can pick up a lot of people at once; therefore, they use less fuel if they are established successfully. Furthermore, environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric motor vehicle can be used for public transportation if promoted by cities. Since cities should pursue sustainable development, public transportation must be improved more.\nOthers argue that roads and highways should be expanded since there are still numerous traffic jams. However, in fact, increasing roads and highways does no help for relieving traffic jams. Traffic jams come from complicated structures and large floating population. Adding more roads and highways will bring negative feedback in traffic jams since it will yield more cars and more floating population. Thus, expanding public transportation is far more appropriate for relieving traffic jams than expanding roads and highways.\nTo sum up, since public transportation is effectual in enhancing traffic systems and eco-friendly, governments should spend more money on improving it. Expanding public transportation will bring better lives for numerous people.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay effectively argues for enhancing public transportation over road expansion, particularly by stating that 'expanding public transportation is far more effective in improving traffic systems,' though it could benefit from more specific examples or data to strengthen the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted because the essay presents a clear structure with a logical flow of ideas, as seen in the transition from discussing public transportation benefits to addressing counterarguments, but the conclusion could be more robust in summarizing key points.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate since the essay demonstrates good use of vocabulary and sentence variety, but it contains some grammatical errors, such as 'owning car is not suitable,' which could be improved to enhance clarity."}]}

Moreover, transportations are necessary to go on a trip or far places to go. Current transportation has many problems, so it is vital to invest in both on roads and highways or public transportation. In my opinion, spending more money on improving roads and highways are needed for three main reasons.\nFirst of all, people drive more cars than public transportation. Investing more money in more people's choice is natural. Besides, many people buy and use cars because they know that public transportation is quite uncomfortable. For example, public transportation has so few seats that it is inconvenient to ride standing up.\nIn addition to more people drive cars, current situations on the roads and highways are awful. When traffic accident, all the cars in the back are congested. In other words, if these things happen on the way to and from work, there will be a catastrophe in which everyone is late. On the other hand, public transportation comes on time and goes along the set road, so there is no traffic accident, and there is much less risk of accidents. For example, in the case of subways, there is no risk of traffic jams, and buses also have designated bus lanes.\nSome argue that investing more in public transportation would be more economical because many people would use it. Only a few years ago this was true; however, considering the current public transportation system, there are so many people that it is very cramped inside. The more people using it, the longer time needed to wait for boarding on it.\nTo sum up, it is desirable to invest more in roads and highways by the above grounds. More people are using cars rather than public transportations; furthermore, more improvements are needed for the roads and highways. Although it is said that public transportations are more economical, there is no space to afford more people. As people should move longer distance, investing in both cars and public transportation are right thing, but spending more in cars are needed for the current circumstances.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5/5 reflects the essay's strong argument for investing in roads and highways, but it is weakened by the lack of specific examples or data to support claims, such as the assertion that public transportation is 'quite uncomfortable' without further elaboration.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5/5 indicates a well-structured essay, yet the transition between points could be improved; for instance, the shift from discussing car usage to the conditions of roads and highways lacks a clear connection, making the argument feel somewhat disjointed.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5/5 highlights generally effective use of vocabulary and sentence structure, but is diminished by grammatical errors such as 'more people's choice is natural' which detracts from clarity and professionalism in writing."}]}

Only 5 cities have subways lines in Korea. It is not reasonable for Korea's traffic characteristics to have weak public transportation. Some people think that Korea need more roads and highways; however, in my opinion, the government should spend more money on improving public transportation especially for trains and subways.\nFirst, increasing more roads in cities of Korea only makes cities more complicated. Korea has very small land and intensive population in specific cities. Therefore, when goverment build more roads and highways in that cities, small cities will be more massive to move. \nSecond, to solve the environment pollution problem, government should spend more money on public transportation. Spending money to improve roads and highways means the government encourages people to use their own cars. USing more car has negative effect on nvironment; for example, using more car caues atmosphere pollution and metal trash on ocean. To prevent these pollution, government should spend more money on public transportation.\nSome argue that roads and highways are needed more because of transport business. However, increasing of trains can handle this problem.Transport industry can be maintained with trains;moreover, transport will be faster when using trains.\nTo sum up, three reasons to spend money on improving public transportation exist. First, increaing subway lines makes intensive population move faster. Second, using public transporatation prevents environmental pollution. Lastly, using train has positive effects on transport industry. For these reasons, the government should spend more money on improving public transportation.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively presents a clear argument for improving public transportation, but it lacks detailed evidence or examples to support its claims, such as specific statistics or studies on the benefits of public transit.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is generally well-structured, with a clear introduction and conclusion, but it suffers from some awkward transitions and repetitive phrasing, particularly in the second paragraph where the phrase 'government should spend more money' is used multiple times without variation.\nJustification for Language: The language used in the essay contains several grammatical errors, such as 'goverment' instead of 'government' and 'USing' instead of 'Using', which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

This is because Korean government spent a lot of money to improve those systems. Nowadays, government still spends a lot of money on these systems, but there is some debate that which system should be more improved. Some people argue that government should spend more money on improving roads and highways, and some argue that government should spend more money on improving public transportation system. Although there are many debates about which system should be more developed, my opinion is that public transportation system should be more developed.\nFirst of all, public transportation system is necessary for lots of people. People who do not have personal cars, such as teenagers and disabled people, must have to use public transportation systems. By considering equality, government should spend more money to develop public transportation for these people.\nAnother reason that public transportation should be developed is the efficiency. in general, public transportation system is more efficient than personal cars or other transportation systems. Moreover, it is easy to develop the public transportation system.\nOn the other hand, some people argue that roads and highways should be developed more because roads and highways are important for people who have personal cars. However, too much personal cars cause a lot of problems. For instance, smoke from personal cars is the main reason of air pollution. In addition, personal cars need parking space for each vehicle. But in Korea, these parking spaces are not efficient because the territory of Korea is small. Therefore, by considering these reasons, public transportation system should be more developed than roads and highways for personal cars.\nTo sum up, since public transportation is necessary for many people and more efficient, government should spend more money in the public transportation system. I hope that someday, I can see more developed and more convenient public transportation system.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5/5 is justified as the essay effectively presents a clear argument for the development of public transportation, supported by relevant points such as its necessity for people without cars; however, it lacks more specific examples or statistics to further substantiate these claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5/5 is warranted because the essay follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly when shifting from the advantages of public transportation to addressing opposing views.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5/5 is appropriate as the essay demonstrates good overall clarity and variety in sentence structure, yet it contains minor grammatical errors, such as 'government spent a lot of money' which should be 'the government spent a lot of money', affecting the professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some people feel that the roads and highways should be improved; however, others feel that there should be more public transportation. In my opinion, governments have to spend more money on improving roads and highways. There are several reasons why road development is a priority.\nFirst of all, there are many roads which have to be improved. For example, at the country, some roads are too narrow that two cars can barely pass by. In addition, some roads are too bumpy; therefore, they can damage to cars. Also, some highways are old and damaged. They need to be check and repaired to prevent accidents.\nIn addition to some old roads, some other roads are difficult to pass due to heavy traffic. The main streets of the big city are heavily congested with traffic for an hour at the rush hour. If the roads are expanded or new roads are built, this problem will be solved. Moreover, the situation on the highway is more serious during the national holidays. Since many people drive to their hometowns, highways should be more developed.\nSome argue that more public transportation is needed. That is true, but the roads should be ready before that. If there are more buses on the current roads, it will be more inefficient and slower than the original. Also, some people do not use public transportation, but there is no one who does not use the roads; therefore, the development of roads should be prioritized. The development of public transportation is possible only when roads are wide and more.\nTo sum up, the government should pay more attention to the development of roads and highways. For this reason, the first is that many roads are now old and require maintenance, and secondly, some roads are complicated. The development of roads is very necessary for people to pass more comfortably and smoothly.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified because the essay effectively presents the argument for prioritizing road development, but it lacks specific data or examples to reinforce the claim, such as statistics on traffic accidents caused by poor road conditions.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is appropriate as the essay follows a logical structure with clear transitions between points, though the concluding paragraph could better summarize the main arguments instead of reiterating them in a less cohesive manner.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted since the essay demonstrates a good command of English, but contains grammatical errors such as 'the country' instead of 'in the country' and awkward phrases like 'should be more developed' that hinder clarity."}]}

Even though computer technology is one of the greatest innovation in the history, some say that it is not important than basic needs. In my opinion, governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology for various reasons.\nFirst of all, computer technology itself is one of the basic needs in modern society. For instance, video meetings and classes are inevitable right now due to COVID-19, and one of most popular identification method is checking one's mobile phone number. On the other hand, a laptop, a smartphone or paying internet bill is quite expensive especially for low-income families. Government should invest on computer technology, including providing basic computational electronics for poor people.\nIn addition to basic needs, various occupations are made thanks to computer technology development. Recently, getting a job is very hard to achieve; it is a big social problem that government should solve. Developing computer technology is one of the best choice to make new occupations without destroying environments.\nSome argue that developing computer technology over other countries is waste of money. According to their opinion, it is enough to catch up recent computer technology in leading countries to use modern advantages. However, investing on computer technology has big potential in the future. For example,  South Korea government had invested significant budget on fast internet during 2000s. As a result, South Korea is not only strong on computer technology, but also strong in cultural impact thanks to quicker exchange of information.\nTo sum up, it is necessary to invest on computer technology since it is one of the basic needs, it makes new occupations, and it gives big potential in the future. Government should pay attention to computer technology, and invest more on it.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay effectively presents multiple reasons for investing in computer technology, such as its role as a basic need and its potential to create new jobs, although it could benefit from more specific examples or data to strengthen its arguments, particularly in discussing the long-term benefits mentioned.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct paragraphs for each point made, but the transition between ideas could be improved for a smoother flow, particularly between the discussion of basic needs and job creation.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted as the essay demonstrates a strong command of vocabulary and sentence structure, yet there are minor grammatical errors, such as 'one of the greatest innovation' which should be 'one of the greatest innovations', indicating room for improvement in accuracy."}]}

Some people say that money should be spent on basic needs because there are many people in Korea who cannot buy own home, eat food that they want. On the other hand, other people say that money should be spent on developing technology, especially computer technology. In my opinion, government should help developing computer technology instead improving basic needs for several reasons.\nFirst of all, developing computer technology can make future lives more convenient. Nowadays, autonomous electronics are developing in many countries, since they are more convenient in several parts. For example, many companies are developing the autonomous vehicles, and other companies are developing smart television or robot that can help our living. Computer technology is strongly needed on these autonomous electronics; since autonomous electronics are moving by computer codes. As a result, spending money on computer technology have high probability to make future lives more convenient.\nNext, South Korea's strength on international trade market is computer technology. Companies like Samsung or LG are in the first group of the electronics, which computer technology is strongly needed. If government does not spend money to computer technology, Samsung or LG can lose their power in the market. That can cause the weakness of the South Korea on international trade market.\nSome arguments say that country can be more stable and stronger when its basic needs are enough. On the other hand, developing computer technology can make power in international market. Then country can get more money by selling computer technology; as a result, country can spend money on basic needs. This cycle will make country more stronger and economically better.\nTo sum up, government should spend money on developing computer technology for several reasons: making future lives more convenient, keeping strength on electronics market, making better cycle on the money in country. Spending money on computer technology cannot affect to people's lives instantly. However, people can live better in the future.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay effectively presents strong arguments for developing computer technology, such as the example of autonomous electronics enhancing convenience, but it lacks more specific examples and evidence to bolster its claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, which includes an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but it could be improved with smoother transitions between ideas, such as the abrupt shift from discussing basic needs to technology development.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted because the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and grammar, evidenced by phrases like 'autonomous vehicles' and 'strongly needed,' but it contains minor grammatical errors, such as 'Korea need money' instead of 'Korea needs money.'"}]}

There are several areas that need government budget, and the government have to divide the money properly. Nowadays, computer technology is considered to be quite important, so some people argue that government should spend much money in this area. On the other hand, others say that there are more basic areas which needs the money. In my opinion, there are several areas other than computer technology which government budget should be spent. \nFirst of all, there are people who do not have their basic life quality; that is, there are people who do not have enough money to eat, wear, or live in a house. They are in too bad circumstances and needs some help of the government. The government should help them live a better life. \nAdditionally, also in the view of technology, the government should spend more money for basic science and mathematics. Many people who are talented in science choose engineering as their major rather than basic science because the money. The budget that is spent on basic science is too less; therefore, people are reluctant to major in basic science. However, basic science is literally the base of all the engineering field. It is very important to improve the quality of basic science in our country. That is the reason why government should spend their budget on the basic science instead of computer technology.\nSome people may say, computer technology is developing fast and the government should follow the pace of development. However, the importance of catching up the computer technology is overestimated. Government can concentrate on improving basic science such as theoretical physics or mathematics and slowly improve the computer technology. \nTo sum up, government budget should be used to help poor people and develop natural sciences. Computer technology is not an urgent problem. If the government uses the budget in more basic areas, the country will be better.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's clear focus on basic areas of government spending, such as aiding the poor and improving basic science, but it lacks depth in exploring the implications of these areas, particularly in the argument about why basic science is more valuable than computer technology, which could have been better articulated.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the logical flow of ideas, as seen in the clear introduction, body paragraphs that address distinct points, and a concise conclusion; however, the transition between the discussion of economic needs and the emphasis on basic science could be smoother to enhance coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is supported by mostly clear expression, but there are grammatical errors such as 'the government have to divide the money properly' instead of 'the government has to divide the money properly,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Computer in present, it can do almost all tasks more and fast than humans. Furthermore, COVID-19 situation makes people to require more computer technology than before since they have restriction for outside works. Indeed, spent more and more money on computer technology will result neglectful investment to basic needs, which is also important to people. However, it is not much important than shortage of technology. Therefore, governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology.\nMost of all, governments should consider how to spend their money most efficiently. Computer technology is the most efficient way to use national treasury since computer technology itself is efficient. There are lots of work that is simple iteration and calculation, but done by humans; computer can replace those tasks more fast without wage. Therefore it is economical and efficient. \nNot only efficiency, computer technology is also future-oriented. Computer is existing everywhere such as refrigerator, television, and washing machine. Consequently, as in future, computer technology will occupy more position on technology market. Governments should prepare those situations by invest and developing computer technology. For example, in near future, machine learning technology can replace jobs that humans only can done such as delicate jobs or recognition tasks.\nSome argues that governments should invest their money to basic need first, because it is exactly what people really requires. Although basic need is essential to people, computer technology can produce basic need more faster than spent govern money to it. Moreover, basic need can be made in factories, which is best to perform computer technology's efficiency because factory is full of simple iteration and calculation. Fully automated factories with high-tech computer technology can produce enough basic needs to people.\nTo sum up, computer technology is efficient and future-oriented. Governments has duty to consider how to use their money efficiently, and think about their future. Therefore, computer technology should be their most important part to spend their state coffers.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for government investment in computer technology, specifically noting that 'computer technology can produce basic need more faster than spent govern money to it,' although the phrase is awkwardly constructed and could benefit from more concrete examples or data to support the claims made.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is supported by the essay's logical flow, with each paragraph building on the previous one, such as the transition from discussing efficiency to future-oriented benefits, but it lacks clear topic sentences that would enhance the clarity of each section.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects some grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, as seen in the sentence 'computer can replace those tasks more fast without wage,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

In my opinion, the government should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying that because computer technology is most important part.\nFirst of all, computer technology is core part of making nations safety. For example, there are too much technology about using or control weapons with computers like using super computer for find and remove enemy's airplanes. Developed Computer technology is basic of them; moreover, that technology makes weapons to protect more stronger. It is important especially for Korea because of awareness of war.\nIn addition to the first reason, computer technology contribute making newest industry. For example, after invention of internet, many industry that use the internet appear; furthermore, they hire a lot of people and make huge markets never be appeared before. That situation makes economy bigger and faster; therefore, people get lots of benefit for internet, a kind of computer technology.\nSome argue that basic science should be grown by governments more because it makes basis of other engineering. However, developed computer engineering contribute to study basic science also. For instance, in dry chemistry labs, they use complicated computer modeling to find some model about interaction between atoms or other materials. That study needs highest developed computer program. Other basic sciences like biology, physics, and mathematics also need computer technology for modeling, simulation, and proof study.\nTo sum up, there are some reasons that governments should develop or buying computer technology; to protect, to make a new industry, to develop basic sciences. Nowadays, the government show movements that reduce spending money for science, include computer technology. Even if the government has not a vary money, it should be spend money for computer technology not only development of computer science but also development of Korea.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay provides clear examples of the importance of computer technology, such as its role in national defense and the creation of new industries, but it lacks depth in discussing the implications of these points, particularly in the paragraph about basic science where the argument could be more thoroughly developed.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is appropriate as the essay follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion; however, the transitions between ideas could be improved, particularly in the shift from discussing national safety to economic benefits, which feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 reflects overall clarity and a good range of vocabulary, but there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'too much technology about using or control weapons' that detract from the overall fluency of the essay."}]}

Despite the claim, some people think governments should spend money on more basic needs. In my opinion, governments should spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology.\nFirst of all, almost high technologies are based on computer technology. To develop high technologies that determine the future of the nation, developing computer technology is necessary.  By developing computer technology, the nation can go ahead of other counties. \nIn addition to developing high technologies, computer technology can give opportunities to lower-income groups. In the case of computer technology, anyone who has a computer can use it. If governments support computers, then lower-income groups can have opportunities to use high technology.\nFinally, some people believe that computer technology removes many jobs, computer technology creates various businesses and jobs. For example, most of the largest companies are based on computer technology and they provide really many jobs. Also, many businesses are created by computer technology.\nTo sum up, developing or buying computer technology develops high technology, gives opportunities to lower-income groups, and creates various businesses and jobs.

Although some believe that governments should spend as much money as possible on basic needs, others suggest that governments need to spend as much money as possible on developing or buying computer technology. In my opinion, spending money on computer technology is needed.\nFirst of all, computer technology makes productivity increase. If the government makes new systems by computers, productivity can increase by saving time.\nIn addition to the activation of productivity, computer technology makes governments powerful. Today, technology of governments means competitiveness. If they have the technology, you will bring a lot of money to their country by participating in other countries' businesses.\nFinally, some argue that computer makes people lose jobs. However, the computer actually increases people who have jobs. The development of computer technology activates the economy. As governments focus on computer technology, many companies will participate in developing computer technology. Developments of computer technology not only make a lot of profits but also increase employees, which leads to the activation of the economy.\nTo sum up, focusing on computer technology should be mandatory.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay presents a clear stance on the importance of computer technology, but it lacks depth in its arguments, such as failing to elaborate on how exactly productivity increases, which weakens the overall content score.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is generally well-structured with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transition between ideas could be smoother, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing productivity to government competitiveness.\nJustification for Language: The language is mostly clear and concise, but there are some grammatical errors, such as 'computer makes people lose jobs' instead of 'computers make people lose jobs,' which detracts from the overall language score."}]}

Not only companies, ordinary people also realize how computer is convinent and important on various area. Justly, computer science became a trend on scientific approach method. Enhancing computer science is one of competition events between nations, thus it is inevitable to spend money on computer technology. There are several reasons why goverments should invest considerable money on computer technology field: diversification of computer language, dominance of future quantum computers and its connection with other fields. \nDespite importance of computer technology, computer langauage is still complicated. To be familiar with computer, they must learn about computer languages and, by extension, to enhance computer technology, they should easily try on computer language. Portion of computer language developers devote to vary computer language to make more easy and intuitive. Goverments should invest developing easier computer langauge and construct big data using collective intelligence. Furthermore, investing on artificial intelligence which use the big data is also needed.  \nMeanwhile, new computer science field, quantum computing, become popular topic. Most of physicists, computer scientists forecast that quantum computing will lead scientific community in the fourth industrial revolution era with its distictly fast computing speed. Goverments must invest on quantum computing field to prepare on next generation. \nSome claim that spending money on computer technology is less important than investing natural scientific fields; however, recent natural scientific fields have derivative field called, computational sicence. They simulate various natural situations, and because they requires huge amount of arithmetic operations, up-to-date CPU is essential. Enhancing computer technology is directly connected with enhancing natural science.  \nConseqeuntly, investing computer technology field is necessary because\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified because the essay presents relevant points about the importance of investing in computer technology, such as discussing the significance of quantum computing, but it lacks depth and specific examples to fully support the claims, such as providing concrete instances of successful investments in computer science.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is warranted as the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, yet it suffers from abrupt transitions, such as the shift between discussing computer languages to quantum computing, which can confuse the reader.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate because the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and sentence structure, but it contains noticeable errors like 'goverments' instead of 'governments' and 'langauage' instead of 'language,' which detract from the overall clarity."}]}

Since the money is finite, the topic of how much to distribute it is inevitable, so it is also sensitive but important. In my opinion, the money should be spent on more basic needs, rather than on developing or buying computer technology, for some reasons.\nFirst of all, a field that often referred to as pure academic is the preceding stage of practical academic. When the investments for basic fields are fulfilled, the country will have potential to more develop on these fields; furthermore, they have greater potential even on the actual field. That is, it is no exaggeration to say that many theories on actual came from basics. For example, mathematics and physics are the most basic disciplines in electronic or mechanical studies.\nIn addition, it is because they are not at the same level as salaries or research support costs for people in the practical. Even in South Korea, investment in engineering colleges with outstanding results is sufficient. On the contrary, there is a shortage of personnel due to the lack of labor and support costs in pure science.\nSome may think that it uncertain to invest much to basic fields. However, there will be no future for the country if the government pays attention to the visible investment.\nIn conclusion, there is a need to invest in pure scholarship as much as or more than the cost of practical studies. Many may have felt that applying without the basics unsettled is not correct.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for prioritizing basic needs over technology investment, but it lacks depth in examples, such as failing to thoroughly explain how basic research directly leads to practical advancements.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted as the essay has a logical structure with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, although the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly in connecting the examples presented.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is supported by the essay's generally strong vocabulary and sentence structure, though it contains awkward phrasing, such as 'it is because they are not at the same level as salaries or research support costs for people in the practical,' which detracts from clarity."}]}

Since then, computer technology became currently most important technology in civilization of twenty-first century. In order to follow the trend, many governments are investing great amount of money for research and development of these technologies. However, there are some groups disagreeing to this modern flow and suggest that nations should use budget instead for basic needs too. Despite these argues, governments must spend as much money as possible for computer technology for few reasons.\nFirst of all, computer technology brings great amount of rich for country. As smartphone is invented, mankind can now access to internet and computer anywhere anytime, and almost every industries need computer to develop and create products. Moreover, due to changes called 'fourth industrial revolution', factories started to be operated by computers, and cars started to drive by itself. If government successfully support company to lead this flow, it is sure thing that the nation will achieve greatest wealth of the world. \nAlso, IT technology are not effected to nation's environmental condition. While manufacturing industries such as oil companies require certain resources, computer industries are not. In addition, biggest benefit of IT technology is that companies can earn great amount of money with less amount of employees; therefore, even countries with small population can be wealthy. Being too hot or too cold is not a matter too. No matter how weather is, computer industry can be developed if only internet is connected; thanks to amazon's AWS service, server computer with large size isn't required too. IT industry is literally open for anyone and any country.\nEven though there exists argument that using these money for poor and reducing rich-poverty gap will help citizens live better life, it is not true, and computer technology will be more beneficial for people. Using tax for social welfare is never a bad thing, but taking those efforts from investment for future is bad thing. Computer technology can increase nation's GDP, and it leads to increase of income for every citizens. Therefore, without spending more account for social welfare, quality of life can be increased for everyone.\nThanks to internet and computer, people are able to enjoy their life and hobby even during pandemic quarantine. Computer technologies still have great unforeseen future, and size of market is constantly increasing for over 20 years. They have limitation for neither resource nor environment, and provides tremendous amount of wealth. In conclusion, investing as much as government can to the industry will be the best choice.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's strong argument for investing in computer technology, but it is weakened by the lack of specific examples or data to support claims, such as the assertion that 'computer technology brings great amount of rich for country.'\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with each paragraph addressing a distinct point; however, the transition between ideas could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing environmental impact to the argument about social welfare.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted due to the effective use of vocabulary and varied sentence structures, but it is undermined by grammatical errors such as 'computer industries are not' and 'biggest benefit of IT technology is that companies can earn great amount of money with less amount of employees.'"}]}

Some assure that computer technology is the most important one in modern engineering field. Even some claim that government should spend as much money as possible for it. However, the government should not spend a lot for computer technology for three reasons.\nFirst of all, there are lots of basic science fields which must be developed; for example, physics and chemistry. Those fields need more budget, and people who have studied in the basic science fields have claimed that the government should spend more money on basic science. According to the statistics from OECD, the investment of the Korean government for the basic science is 56th out of 150 conturies. Considering that Korea is an advanced contury, that result is too nonsense. Even the basic sciences are the necessary ones for developing computer technology. Instead of spending much money only for computer science, making investment to the basic science would show much better results.\nIn addition to the investment for basic sciences, securing a budgeet for welfare also necessary. Recently, the gap between rich and poor is more and more increasing. It is not the only welfare problem and there exist too many problem in Korean society such as the price of real estimate, education fee, and employment difficulties.\nSome argue that developing computer science would make much more money than ever before. However, our contury, Korea, has mainly made profits by selling semiconductor chips for smartphones, cars, and ships to other conturies. The computer is not the main soure of trade profit. Also, even if the government tries to develop computer science, it would be difficult to profit because there already exist too strong computer enterprises like Intel, Microsoft, and Google. \nTo sum up, the government should not spend a lot for computer technology. The reasons are simple. Our contury, Korea, necessarily need more budget for basic sciences and welfare. Ultimately, it is too difficult to make money with computer technology since that filed already became a red ocean a few decades before. What it means is that it is time to consider and solve the basic needs.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5/5 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument against government spending on computer technology, supported by relevant examples such as the need for investment in basic sciences, though it could have benefited from more specific data or examples to strengthen its claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5/5 is warranted as the essay is logically structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion; however, the transition between ideas could be improved, particularly between the discussion of welfare issues and the argument against computer technology investment.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5/5 is appropriate as the essay employs generally clear language and varied sentence structures, but it contains several grammatical errors, such as 'conturies' instead of 'countries' and 'budgeet' instead of 'budget', which detract from overall clarity."}]}

Because of the large scale of investment, governments are now spending money on computer technology, as a part of the national policy; however, some argue that the money should be spent on more basic needs, such as infrastructure, and public welfare. In my opinion, developing computer technology is more important in several reasons.\nFirst, development of computer technology can increase efficiency of the entire society. Nowadays, most parts of the society has been automated and mechanized. Moreover, computer technology are used to control those processes; therefore, with better computer technology, the society can not only reduce unnecessary steps, but also create new methods on task. \nIn addition to efficiency improvement, development of computer technology enables new idea to become true. For example, in past, the idea about artificial intelligence was story of scientific fantasy; but, it became true in the modern society, by development of computer technology.\nAlthough some claim that development of computer technology will take away human jobs, it rather creates new innovative jobs in the society. It is true that some jobs that require simple work will replaced my machine, however there are new jobs that use computer technology like computer engineer, robot scientist, and many other jobs.\nTo sum up, the computer technology is important for society because it increase efficiency and new attempts, and jobs in society.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified because while the essay presents several valid points about the importance of computer technology, it lacks depth in its arguments, such as failing to adequately explain how computer technology creates new jobs beyond merely listing examples like 'computer engineer' and 'robot scientist.'\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, as it effectively uses separate paragraphs for each main point, but it could be improved by providing smoother transitions between ideas, such as the abrupt shift from efficiency to job creation.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted due to the overall clarity and good use of vocabulary, although there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as 'the idea about artificial intelligence was story of scientific fantasy,' which detracts from the overall professionalism of the writing."}]}

Especially, computer technology is taking a large part in the electronics industry and necessary for our daily life; however, it does not mean that governments should use all the money in computer technology. There should be investments in other areas such as food, houses, and education for several reasons.\nFirst of all, there is no reason for computers when people do not know how to use it. People who are old or living in a poor village did not have chances to use recent electronic devices; therefore, even if governments bought and gave computers to these people, they would not know how to use it. Education should proceed before handing out computers.\nIn addition to the need for education, computers are not everything in our life. Food, clothing, and shelter are the basics of life which is the most important thing in life that needs to be achieved first. There are lots of people who do not have something to eat or somewhere to live. Governments should primarily use the money for the ones that lack basic needs.\nSome say advances in technology is directly connected to improvement in the quality of life, but advances in technology will only make the rich's life better. Those who have the money to buy the result of developed technology will earn more money while the poor suffer from a lack of technology which will result in polarization of wealth.\nTo sum up, trying to spend money as much as possible on the computer will only result in the polarization of the wealth and pain of the poor.

For example, in KAIST, do a multiple major is one of thing to graduate. Of course, do a one major more specialized is one option, but most students in KAIST is doing multiple major because that is more helpful for the future. I also think varied subject is better. In 21st century, you have to live much longer, maybe 100 years, so you can't do just one jobs. So learning many subject is needed. Also, differently contrast to the past, many subject is going to mixed and got complex. So just one specific major is not that helpful to work. Many fields is created and will be created, so knowing about many subject is more helpful to adjust in new mixed fields. For example, many universities is forcing students to got minor subject, and lots of universities is recommending to got double major because one major is not helpful to raise people more adaptive in social. Also, do a one subject deeply is not for most students. For people that want to be a scholar is needed to learn deep study, but most people will not be a scholar. They will be a person work in more realistic ground, and that doesn't require deep information and knowledge. Realistic field need flexible thought, so if person know about varied subjects, that will help more than a person that know one subject. So knowing about many subject is recommended from social, company and country. For example, lots of group like company is needed to survive, so adaptive is more needed than scholar knowledge.\u2003\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 9.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument in favor of multiple majors, but it lacks sufficient detailed examples and analysis, such as when the author states, 'Many fields is created and will be created,' which is vague and does not provide specific evidence to support the claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 reflects the essay's somewhat disorganized structure, as ideas are presented in a convoluted manner, exemplified by the abrupt transition between discussing the necessity of multiple majors and the mention of scholars, which disrupts the overall flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'do a multiple major is one of thing to graduate,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Commonly, most of the students in university have their own major. On the other hand, some universities require their students to study various subjects. Through this point, students may be expert other than their major. However, I think that this kind of strategy may harm students' knowledge. I insist that universities must require students to specialize in their own major. I can give you three reasons.\n First of all, taking classes other than their major consumes time to study their own major. According to my experience, my major is computer science. I take two or three classes about my major for each semester. However, I also take one or two classes about art or religion, because KAIST require students to study these parts for graduation. In the week for preparing exam, I need to study art or religion in the time that I planned for studying my major. Every semester, It feels like burden to me.\n Next, students must be expert in their major. Ideally, if the students take classes in many subjects, they can be expert in various areas. However, the time is limited, so students cannot take sufficient classes for each subject. When they graduate, students may not know sufficiently about every subject they studied in university. I think that 4 years in university is not long enough for studying only one subject. For instance, there are students that graduate university for 5 or 6 years. It means that even for one subject, 4 years may not be sufficient.\n Last, studying other subject must be selective. There can be students who want to study classes in many subjects. In KAIST, students can enroll in most of the class regardless of their own major. For instance, you can enroll in data structure class even if your major is life science. Furthermore, if you meet specific standard, you can have dual degree that shows you are expert in another subject, too. You must be expert in your major first, and looking for other classes must be not prior to your major.\n To sum up, universities must require students to specialize in one subject. There are three reasons to support my idea. Taking other class with their major need much time. Also, students may not be major in various subjects and studying many subjects must not be forced. I'm also undergraduate student in KAIST. I think that I must be expert in my major first, and other classes must be followed by major. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified because the essay provides clear arguments supporting the claim that students should specialize in their major, such as the point that taking other classes consumes time intended for their major, although it could benefit from more specific examples or evidence to strengthen these claims further.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted as the essay follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs outlining distinct reasons, and a conclusion, but it would benefit from smoother transitions between paragraphs to enhance flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate since the essay demonstrates good command of language and vocabulary, yet there are grammatical errors, such as 'must be expert' instead of 'must be experts' and awkward phrasing like 'it feels like burden to me,' which detract from clarity."}]}

Let's suppose if I have to specialize in one subject, here in KAIST. At first, it'll be seem as I became somewhat professional in my subject. But as soon as I graduate the school, I'll probably find out myself premature man in other subject. Whatever I do after graduation, a job that requires only single profession in particular subject won't exist. Society's needs are getting more and more complicated, and that's why some simple knowledge outside one's field, at least, is important.\nEven though I'm in the field of science, studying about humanism is important. It is impossible to do a research without having own philosophy and direction of mind related to research. And of course, there is no researcher only researching in one's life. To fight with problems I encountered during my life, I have to learn the strategies to fight, which is called humanism.\nSomeone can say that still there is a job that needs only one kind of specialization. But as I said, every kind of job demands more and more complicated abilities these days. The job which needs only one kind of specialization will soon disappear. If that happens, and I don't get any preparation, I'll eventually have to learn from other subjects. So why can it be bad to study early?\nHere's my conclusion. Students have to satisfy complicated needs of society and fight out with their private problems in their future. To do so, it is essential to get an acknowledgement in other subjects. Requirement of some universities making students to take classes in many subjects is clearly reasonable policy.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a solid argument regarding the importance of interdisciplinary study, but the essay lacks depth in exploring specific examples of how knowledge from other fields can directly benefit a professional career, such as providing concrete instances of interdisciplinary applications in science.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is warranted as the essay presents ideas in a somewhat disjointed manner, particularly in the transition between discussing the need for humanism and the conclusion, which does not clearly summarize or reinforce the main arguments.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is justified due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'it'll be seem as I became somewhat professional', which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

The combination is very important factor in many areas.\nOur school, KAIST also require students to classes in many subjects through the rule of 4track. It is the rule that all of KAIST students should have more than one major with main major and another major. If students want have more major, KAIST support the willing of students. While studying in KAIST for 1years, I felt many merit for the 4track rule. So, I think that universities require students to take classes in many subjects is good for students based on my experience. There are two reasons for my opinion.\n First, we can make innovative ideas, technology that we haven't seen before by mixing the knowledge in many kinds of field. \n The second reasons is that we can reflect many opinions of many people by applying various experience, knowledge when we make somethings such as goods, rule. People have each different require, need, favorite.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\u00a0\n\nEssay to evaluate:\n Taking classes in many subject and specializing in single subject are both great options. However, if I really had to make a choice between two options, I would prefer the latter, which is taking classes in specialized single subject. There are three reasons for this idea.\n First of all, classes in specialized one subject is helpful for students' career. In many cases, jobs usually require deep knowledge, not wide knowledge. For instance, even if doctor knows wide range of knowledge, doctor without deep knowledge of biology and medical skills cannot be a good doctor. Maybe someone said that wide range of knowledge can help us sometimes, but we should remember that deep knowledge, not wide knowledge is base for every jobs. Of course, universities' education that based on one specialized subject will help students build base for future career.\n In addition to this, make student to take classes in many subject can be detrimental. If student have to take classes in many subject, he should take not only classes in subject that he likes to learn, but also classes in subject that he dislikes to learn. Forcing student to take classes in subject that he dislike can make student to lose his passion for learning new things. In worst case, losing passion for learning new things can caused to passion for his major too. As we can see from this example, make students to specialize in one subject could be better option.\n Finally, learn deeply in one subject can offer power to challenge other subjects. Personally, in my case, I can learn different computer language such as C and Java well after I learn much about python, which is programming language that easier to learn. As example shows, deep knowledge in one specific area can help to understand other topics in different area too. Also, It can give us passion to challenge new topics in different major. So, I think that specializing in one subject is the first step for student to learn things in many subjects.\n For these reasons, I think that specializing in one subject is much better than take classes in many subjects.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents clear reasons for preferring specialization, such as the assertion that 'jobs usually require deep knowledge, not wide knowledge', though the argument could have been strengthened by providing more concrete examples of how specialization directly benefits career prospects.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted since the essay follows a logical structure with clear topic sentences for each paragraph, yet the transition between ideas could be improved, particularly between the second and third paragraphs, where the connection between losing passion and specialization is somewhat abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate as the essay demonstrates a good command of language despite some grammatical errors, such as 'make student to take classes' instead of 'making students take classes', which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\u00a0\n\nEssay to evaluate:\n  Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. On the other hand, other universities require students to specialize in one subject. In my opinion, I agree with the first case based on two reasons. First, there are many restricts to produce new creative things with only one subject these days. Second, even in the university, there should be chances for student to search for their real dreams.\n  First of all, a person who have specialized in one specific subject is likely to be lack of a wide competence. I am currently double majoring in Computer science and Industrial design. Many courses of the department of the Industrial design for the students in more than third year requires the ability to make a computer program, being able to embedded in the product. In other words, there are lots of assignment or projects requiring not only designing the products that looks beautiful but also giving special functions to them. For example, some students majoring in Industrial design produces a color-changing lamp that recognizes the color of marbles which the user put into the lamp or a music player that plays love songs when the user draw a heart shape or songs related with rain when the user draw a rain drop shape on the player. Many students in the department of industrial design now choose Computer science of Electrical Engineering as their double major or minor, since it allows them to show more powerful performances with various knowledge.\n  Furthermore, since students are still learners, not workers yet, they have to experience different fields that they have not done before. In Korea, students should choose their future job to go to an university usually when they just became a high school student. They have to focus on only one field and look for the very subject so that there are something they can show to the universities. One of my friends in KAIST is now majoring in Electrical engineering although his wanted-subject was Machine engineering when he was a freshman, and another friend, also in KAIST, is now majoring in Industrial design even though her first wanted-subject was Biological science. As anybody can see, since it is too early to choose only one subject that they have to specialize forever for 17-year-old high school students or 20-year-old freshmen, universities have to give more opportunity for students to search for many other subjects.\n  In conclusion, I strongly agree with the statement that universities requiring students to take class in many subject is better than other universities requiring students to specialize in one subject. Firstly, students can achieve wide view throughout various subjects, which can be applied to their future works usefully. Moreover, since most of students who are only 20 or 21 years old are too young to find the thing that they really want to be, universities have to be the places for students to spread their wings by letting them experience more subjects than they expected. Also for me, taking classes in many subjects in KAIST have been a pretty helpful experience.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's strong argument supporting the benefits of taking classes in multiple subjects, as seen in the detailed examples of students combining industrial design with computer science, but it could be improved by providing more diverse examples or evidence to strengthen the argument further.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but it could benefit from smoother transitions between ideas to enhance the overall flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate due to the use of varied vocabulary and sentence structures, yet there are grammatical errors such as 'a person who have specialized' instead of 'a person who has specialized', which detracts from the overall clarity."}]}

Although some may argue that the requirement is mandatory for students' personal growth, the students should not be forced to take classes they do not wish to take, for it is their right to choose the relevant path of growth that they desire.\n\nIt is the students themselves not the college administrator that acknowledge thier academic needs which suits thier career path in their onw lives better than anyone else. Therefore, the courses of the most versatile skills might not be relevant to some participants at all. For instance, the course \"General Biology\", which should not be considered \"general\" in any way, is required for the entirerity of KAIST undergraduate students. The course prove to be relevant for some, but definitely not for those who seek pure mathematics degree.\n\nStudents should have a glimpse into many field for thier all-around academic development. Nevertheless, they should not be force to enroll or choose to enroll from the limited amount of courses the university provide, as some students may already learned and experienced them already outside of the class, and the time in university may be better spent enhancing skills that are absolutely neccesary.\n\nFinally, some might argue that some course should and must be learnt no matter what the crrer path and thier prior experience. They might be right, but the judgement should be place upon the students themselves. The students are conscious and intelligent beings who can weigh advantages and disadvantages of a course. The college administrator can and should recommend courses to enroll, but the final desicion should be \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument against mandatory courses, but it lacks depth in exploring the benefits of a well-rounded education, as seen in the assertion that 'the courses of the most versatile skills might not be relevant to some participants at all' without further elaboration.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 reflects a generally coherent structure, but the essay's conclusion is abruptly cut off, undermining the clarity of the final argument when it states, 'the final desicion should be,' leaving the reader without a complete thought.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to multiple grammatical errors and typos, such as 'thier' instead of 'their' and 'neccesary', which detract from the overall readability and professionalism of the essay."}]}

I have many reasons to support my opinion. First, Nowadays, global cooperation and comunication is essential. We can't develop nor improve anything without working with each other, since science is too complicated for one person or one lab to handle. So, to communicate, we have to have a common laguage across the world and it is now english. This why we have to learn english in universities. But not only english, other parts of science different from your major are important and this would be my second reason. Like I said above, cooperation is important and when I mean by 'cooperation', it means cooperation between different parts of science too. We could specialize one subject and investigate new theories, but since all parts of science have the same base after all, eventually we have to know all of them or at least some of them to study your major efficiently. Third, a scientist with no moral thoughts is a disaster. A scientist can be a two-sided blade depending on his/her decision and you can realize that this is true through history. So, to be a scientist with right moral thoughts, we have to learn other subjects like reading books, discussion, history and so on. These subjects would help us to be great scientist who helps human race to have a more convienient life. These are my 3 reasons and to conclude, I think it is all about cooperating and comunicating with other people from different country and different interests, and to do this, learning many kinds subjects in university is a very important thing in the present and also in the future.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified because, although the essay presents three reasons for supporting a broad curriculum, the arguments are underdeveloped, such as the assertion that 'a scientist with no moral thoughts is a disaster,' which lacks specific examples or elaboration.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is warranted as the essay follows a basic structure with an introduction and three reasons, but the transitions between ideas are weak, making it difficult to follow the progression of thoughts, especially in the shift from language learning to moral considerations.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate because the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and grammar, but it contains several spelling errors, such as 'comunication' and 'convienient,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

It will be helpful to work with other peoples.\nThird, take classes in many subjects can help people who have not interested in specific subject yet or who wants to change their specialized subject.\nMany people said me when we choose subjects that we are not interested in, or subject that are different with our thinking, it is very tired and hard to concentrate in study.\nSo there are many people who wants to change their specialized subject.\nLearning many subjects can gives people experience to find their own interest.\nLast, but not least, find and choose subjects that they want to listen can make people learn more effectively.\nWhen people choose subjects they are interested in, they are very actively participate in learning, and who do not have interest yet, they can easily change classes they take, and it helps people find their own interest faster.\nFrom these reasons, I think take classes in many subject is better.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 7.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects the essay's lack of depth, as evidenced by the claim that 'one subject is related with many other subjects' without providing specific examples or explanations to support this assertion.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 is justified by the essay's unclear structure, particularly the abrupt transition between ideas, such as moving from the benefits of understanding differing opinions to discussing the challenges of choosing subjects without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in 'take classes in many subject' where 'subject' should be pluralized to 'subjects,' which hinders clarity and fluency."}]}

Nowadays, many university, for example KAIST and POSTECH, require students to take classes in many subjects. The direction of education change to taking many subjects. In this paper, it talks about that taking many subjects is better than taking one subject. There are three reasons for supporting this opinion.\n First of all, taking many subject gives many chances. You take one subject but, you don't like this subject. If you are taking only one subject, you should do this subject forever. If you are taking many subjects, you can take other subjects then you can choose your best subject. For example, you study circuit theory in this semester but, you don't like it then, you can listen other subject.\n At second, taking many subject makes brain strong. If you study many subjects, you can make your brain strong. For example, you study calculus and electromagnatics. Calculus is helpful for studying electromagnatics so, your brain power can grow up by taking many subject.\n Finally, taking many subject can make new area. For example, electric engineering is born 50 years ago. Electric engineering is mixing of physics and mathmatics. This means if people don't take mathmatics and physics both, electric engineering can't exist. Taking many subject can make new subject and area.\n In conclusion, taking many subjects is better than taking one subject. First reason is taking many subject gives many chances. Second reason is taking many subject makes brain strong. Final reason is taking many subject can make new area. By these reasons, taking many subjects is very important.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified because the essay presents a clear opinion that taking many subjects is better than specializing in one, but it lacks depth and specific examples to support its claims, such as when it states, 'you can take other subjects then you can choose your best subject' without elaborating on how this benefits students.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but it could be improved by enhancing the transitions between ideas, for instance, the phrase 'At second' is awkward and could be better articulated as 'Secondly' to maintain flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 reflects issues with grammar and word choice, such as in the phrase 'you can listen other subject,' which should be corrected to 'you can take another subject,' demonstrating a lack of fluency and accuracy in language usage."}]}

This world impels you to learn various things for live well, like cooking, finance adjusting, handling various kind of machines, and typical high school subjects, etc. But should we have to take classes in many subjects in university than specializing in one subject? For this question, I both agree about two statement, but more strongly agree with specializing.\n  First, most important, people cannot be skillful for many areas. Some talented people can be ofcourse, but most people have talent for less than one over two. Requring students to take in many subjects will be wasting of human resources. For the limited human resources, I think it is important to develop specific specialized areas first, and after that we can develop other areas for collaboration or brilliant ideas. Teaching students many subjects will be big loss from view of efficiency.\n  Second, it is important to focusing on growth of specialist in this internet society. Internet made our life much easier. We can find various kind of information in the internet with just for one or two clicks. We can contact with very basic knowledge of area, but also with specialized knowlege too. It means people can learn and use almost every kind of knowledge if they want to. So, basic knowledge will be reproduced from many people who are interested in those areas. In other word, teaching basic knowledge in many subjects (for start) will be useless. Importance is in teaching specialized knowledge. We have to focus on making specialists, who will develop quality of knowledge which will make our human life more comfortable. One specialist is much better than many amatuers.\n  Last, it gives student much stress. College students have to handle with many situations which is not related to study too. They already have much stress for other things like money, relationships, future. But if we require student to take class in many subjects and evaluated, their stress of study will be raise so far. Because they are not talented for various area, but college say them to get good grade and scores for that areas. It is very stressful for people who have thoughts that they should be good in areas which they're not talented.\n  For these three reasons, I agree with specializing in one subject. Ofcourse it is important to learn various subject to become good specialists in the future, but I think studying other areas should be followed by learning specialized knowledge first.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 5.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument in favor of specializing in one subject, supported by relevant points such as the inefficiency of requiring students to study multiple subjects, but it could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples or data to support these claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is appropriate because the essay has a clear structure with distinct paragraphs for each argument, but the transition between ideas could be improved, particularly in the second paragraph where the shift to discussing the internet's role feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the essay's relatively clear communication of ideas, yet it contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'complicately connected world' and 'Requring students to take in many subjects will be wasting of human resources', which detract from its overall clarity."}]}

It is obvious that many advantages exist when learning diverse subjects, such as diverse information of other subjects which helps cooperation with others. However, Universities requiring students to specialize in one subject are better for several reasons.\nFirst,  students can learn more advanced information from professors. Professors can teach students about there upcoming studies if students have enough background knowledge. Most of studies that professors do are very advanced that students cannot comprehend.  However, if school require students to specialize in one subject, the lecture will be helpful for students who are having problem on choosing future career. For example, \nFreshman seminar in KAIST is giving students information about studies in progress now on, but most of freshman cannot comprehend it. It would be more helpful if students are specialized.\nNext, students are less stressed from studying subjects which are unfamiliar with. It is clear that a student cannot be good at all the subjects that the university requires. some students will hate mathematics, some will hate biology. This comes as a big stress for students because some subjects are totally different with each other. For example, mathematics and biology have different structures of information. biology gives information with memorizing, but mathematics gives information with usage of basic skills.  \nLast, professors can prepare for classes easily. If students take class in diverse subjects, It gives hardness on taking a schedule\nThere are only limited times on studying subjects in university.

Not only KAIST, but also many university in Korea used to demand their student to study many subjects as many as they can. According to these examples, I think university that requires their students to take various courses is better than others. Then, why universities that courage students to deal with many subjects are better?\n       First of all, world which we are living in has multiple complex problems. Unlike prior world, human kinds are facing difficult issues like global warming or nuclear issues. Theses kind of problems cannot be solved without various perspective and approches. This means that specialist who is only specialized in one subject cannot solve complex problems or misled easily. Thus, it should be better to require students to face various subjects and experience enormous kinds of problem within.\n       Moreover, dealing with many subjects can be helpful for improving student's insight. Even if two different subjects are dealing with same problem, each subject's goals and approches has lots of difference. For example, thermodynamics in physics is used to predict how universe will change in the future. But, thermodynamics in chemistry is used to estimate whether this reaction is spontaneous. Eventually, when we study various subjects which taught us many kinds of techniques to solve problems, it will improve our insight toward world.\n      In short, studying various courses and subjects can make us live well in world with complex problems and give us brilliant insights. Therefore, university which gives students a oppertunnity to deal with various subjects is better than university which requires students to be specialized.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the lack of depth in the argument, as the essay fails to adequately explain how a diverse curriculum directly contributes to solving complex problems, only mentioning global warming and nuclear issues without providing concrete examples or evidence to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate because the essay follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion; however, it could benefit from smoother transitions between ideas, such as better linking the first and second paragraphs.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is justified due to generally clear expression and appropriate vocabulary, but there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as 'Did you knew' instead of 'Did you know,' which detracts from the overall fluency of the essay."}]}

The efficiency can be maximized when I study with lots of students.

Also, I can ask tutor about difficult part or interesting part. By tutoring, I got a good grade in math.\nAlso, I can notice which I don't know by discussing with each other.

Because there is less stress than study with many people.\nSo I watched 'youtube' and 'facebook'. However, when I study with a lot of students I have more stress than studying myself. So I can focus my study well.\nAlso, there is some competence like I want to study more than he or she.

First, I can focus on studying for the long time. I can't focus when others do other things except studying. So, I need my own place to study. When I study, I don't prefer to go cafeteria or library. There is so many people in there. I can't focus on my own. Second, I can refresh myself whenever I want. If I play the game or others when I study with my friend, friend can't study well. Surely, It might be a bad thing. It is hard to control time to rest. Also, I can eat lunch or dinner  and finish my studying when I want. I can plan my time very easily. There is many helpful thing when study with a group of students. I prefer to study with a group in a few case. I can ask my question to them when I want. I can have answer easier than studying alone. Also, group can make a homework with my group.  If I don't do homework in a due date, I need to give my money to group. When I study TOEIC that famous English test in Korea , I usually use this way to study English word.  It is very great way to study English to me. If I study English alone, I can't remember English words.  Actually, I don't like to study English. Any other subject like Mathematics or Science, I can study myself well and focus easily. But English, It is very hard to me to focus for the long time. So, I choose way to study with a group.\nFinally. I usually prefer to study alone when i study subjects that I can focus easily. But If I can't focus it, I choose way to study with a group. Each way has a good things and bad things. Studying alone, I can focus more easily and control the studying plan like lunch time or break time. Second case, I can take answer of my question easily. If there is homework, I should do it in a due date.\nI recommend you to try both ways and choose one that you like. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 8.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects the essay's inclusion of relevant points about studying alone and in groups, but it lacks depth, as seen in the superficial discussion of studying English, where the author states, 'I don't like to study English,' without providing further elaboration on how it affects their learning experience.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 indicates that the essay presents ideas in a somewhat disjointed manner, as evidenced by the abrupt transitions between points, such as jumping from personal preferences to the benefits of group study without clear connections or a logical flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'There is many helpful thing when study with a group of students,' which diminishes clarity and coherence throughout the essay."}]}

Even in my high school, everyone's style in study is dramatically different. So it is hard to normalize idea about study. But in my case, I used to prefer studying with a group of students. I think study with a group of students is very efficient for learning something in following three reasons.\n\n     First of all, studying with a group of students allows to collaborate with others. When I study, I often conflict to some part that I can not understand easily. If there is any friends who study same part with me, we can share our idea. If I don't know something in textbook, other students in group can help me. In same way, I can help other members. So, it is easy to learn a knowledge in study with a group of students. One more additional advantage is that we can check out misunderstood idea in learning. It means that studying with a group of student contains a process of crosschecking misunderstood concepts.\n\n     Second, studying with a group can trigger creative idea in learning. A few years ago, I visited a IT venture company. I was wonder about the space of company. The reason was that there are a lot of sharing space rather than conventional company building. Even, They doesn't have blind between each seat and easy to communicate. The purpose of that is to make more event of sharing idea between members. They said a lot of creative idea is triggered in communicate with others. This is same to study. I also realize that I can make creative idea in studying with a group of students. A few months ago, I prepared final exam of differential equation with my friends. At that time, we could find a very efficient and creative way to solve differential equation that is not introduced in textbook or professor. Like this cases, we can make creative idea by studying with a group of students.\n\n     Some people argue that it is good to study alone. My parents also emphasized that studying alone makes high efficient in learning. This is related to Korean tradition concept about study. In Joseon dynasty, a lot of scholars go to hidden forest and study with deep-thinking in his own mind. They believe this is the best way to study. This concept about study even affect modern society of Korea. However, I can not agree that old-fashioned idea. Because some brand-new brain-engineering research shows that our memory is related to any other senses; hearing, speaking and conversation. If we study with group of student, we use a lot of senses. Our brain easy to memory the content with our used sense. For example, if you explain something to your friends, our brain can memory much more that just reading same content.\n\n     For these three reasons, I prefer study with a group of students. We can collaborate with others, make creative idea and easily memory something by studying with a group of students. Why not study with your friends? If you studied alone now, just try to study with a group of students. It can be a new paradigm to efficient, creative, easy study.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified because the essay effectively presents three clear reasons for preferring group study, such as collaboration and creativity, but it could have been strengthened by providing more concrete examples or studies to support these claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted as the essay is structured logically with clear topic sentences for each paragraph, but it slightly lacks smooth transitions between some ideas, particularly in the shift from discussing collaboration to creativity.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 reflects the author's generally clear and understandable writing style, although there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as 'there are a lot of controversial idea' instead of 'there are a lot of controversial ideas,' which detracts from the overall quality."}]}

If I can't understand some theories, or If there are some problems that I can't solve, then I can ask to others students. If I study alone, then I have to search it by my own. Sometimes, Google can answer for me, but some problems are hard to find in Google too. Also, in this process, friends teach me some skills that are useful in exam too. It makes me to study more easier and get better grade in exam.\nSecond, I can know better by answering for other students too. By answering questions for friends, I can repeat the components that I studied, so I can remember it better. Also, I can notice what theories I don't know exactly too. So answering questions make me to know better about it. \nThird, other students motivate me to study hard. When I was in high school, my studying's motivation was almost made up by my friends. When I see my friends study hard, I thought \"I have to study hard too\". So I can more concentrate to my study. But not every friends study hard. Some friends want to spend time to play games or having fun rather than studying. So, some friends don't concentrate and talk to me. But, when they do those things, I think \"I am going to do opposite things with them\". In this mind settings, I can study hard with any kind of other students.\nIn conclusion, I prefer to study with a group of students. Because I can ask questions to other students, I can know better when by answering question, and other students motivate me to study hard.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's clear articulation of reasons for preferring group study, but the strength is diminished by vague statements such as \"some problems are hard to find in Google too,\" which lacks specificity and depth in explaining the challenges faced when studying alone.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the presence of a clear introductory statement and separate points for each argument, yet the essay suffers from a lack of smooth transitions, as seen in the abrupt switch from discussing motivation to the challenges posed by friends who do not study, which disrupts the flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is supported by generally understandable expression, but is weakened by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in \"it makes me to study more easier and get better grade in exam,\" which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Someone like to study alone, others like to study with a group. These two way have each strong points, But I recommend group studying for you.\n Studying with group have advantages. First, teaching each other make people understand well. You maybe think teaching each other is just good for student who get teaching, but it is not. In my case, I often explain science to my friend. Thanks for this, I can study obviously again, also get other knowledge from my friends. One scientist say, \"If you cannot explain the knowledge for children, you don't know that ,too\" I really agree this sentence.\n Next, There is miss point when you study alone. It is hard to find your mistake yourself. Without other's advise, If you miss something, nobody know your miss point and tell you that. You will know your mistake when you check your exam score. That is too late. With Study group, you cannot undergo this situation.\n Also, group studying improve your willing. Many people become gentle person for themselves. However, someone can see what they do, people do something more. Therefore, study with group make observer who watch what you do. Although you are shy, you can more study.\n To sum up, teaching for others make you study again, your group members find your mistake before exam, and it make observers for making you study. For these reasons, I prefer to study with group of students. Why don't you make your 'studymate'?\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's adequate exploration of the advantages of group studying, yet it lacks depth in examples, such as not providing specific instances of how group studying has positively impacted the author's academic performance beyond a single anecdote about explaining science.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is warranted as the essay has a clear structure with distinct paragraphs for each main point, but it could be improved by enhancing the transitions between ideas, such as the abrupt shift from discussing teaching to the difficulties of studying alone.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 highlights several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in the sentence 'Someone like to study alone, others like to study with a group,' which should be 'Some like to study alone, while others like to study in groups,' indicating a lack of command over language conventions."}]}

In study cafe, there are some lots of options. There is a room for group meeting, self-studying, and public places with normal tables like library. Like this variances, lots of people have their different preference about studying alone or with a group. In my cases, I prefer to study alone for several reasons.\nFirst, studying alone can makes you concentrate easily. When we study alone, we often find quite place to concentrate. However, if we study with a group of students, we will talk each other to ask some questions, and it can distrupt the concentration. Even if these question is related to our studying, there are some probabilites that we can move on to the unrelated topic.\nNext, we don't have to find the group studying place. For group studying, there must be a place that we can communicate each other, but without making the large noise to surroundings. This limit make us to do the effort for finding the right place. Besides, studying alone do not need to find that place. For example, if we want to do group studying in KAIST, we have to register the seminar room before the group meeting. However, we can just go to library if we want to study alone. Or we can study in our dormitory.\nFinally, because of COVID-19, we should study alone rather than study with a group of students. During this COVID-19 situation, studying at home is the best way to maintain the social distance. Even if we have an online group studying method like zoom, that is not good enough to concentrate well. For example, the low quality of internet connections give us stress to maintain the group meeting. Zoom also limits the meeting time for the free account, so we have to spend more money to make a perfect condition. \nIn conclusion, I prefer to study alone because it can concentrate easily, no effort to find a group meeting place, and COVID-19 situation. Of course this is only my opinion, so there are some students like to study with a group. There is no strict answer for studying. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for studying alone, citing personal preferences and supporting reasons, such as the ability to concentrate more easily, but it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or data to support the claims made.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by the logical flow of ideas, with clear transitions between paragraphs, yet the essay could benefit from a stronger introduction that more effectively sets up the argument or thesis statement.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 reflects the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'studying alone can makes you concentrate easily,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

He said that we can share our knowledge or opinion during study. It is helpful to study and preparing the exam. But my another friends said different. I prefer study with friends. Let me give you some reasons about it.\n First, if we study together I can concentrate more than studying alone. In my case, I play games or watch youtube and netflix when I study at my room. It is hard to concentrate for a long time. But in study cafe, library, and cafe, there are lots of people who studying. In that concentrating space, I concentrate well. Making uncomfortable environment is important for concentration. \n Second, we can help each other by sharing our knowledge or opinions. When we study new subject first, it is difficult to understand well. For me, I learned linear mathematics first in march, it was really hard to understand it.

Math give you many concepts and you have to understand them. \nBeing taught by others helps you to understand things too, but you have to clarify them while you study alone. \nIf you learn 'vector' and all other calculating methods about vector in class, then it is better to study them alone and try calculating methods by yourself.\n\nStudying in groups is quite different. It is really efficient when I need to enhance my skills.\nYou can't be good at math if you are only good at understanding concepts. It is good when you need to share your skills, solve a hard problem which requires many different skills to solve.\nWhen you need to solve a very hard vector problem, It can be really helpful to study together and learn their various skills.

To master the contents or subjects, you firstly have to hear a basic explanation about them, secondly, have a time to understand and practice on your own.  The first step can be carried in many ways : asking a teacher, googling. But the second step is an internalizing step for you, so it can be carried only by studying alone that contains your own thoughts, comprehension. The group studying can not do this. \n\nIt is just a repeat of the first step with other students.\n\n         So far, I have talked about the reasons I insist studying alone is a better way compared to the group studying.

Most of you have studied alone, sitting on the desk in the quiet classroom. If not, you have studied in the study room, where the walls are separating every person in the room. These days, different studying method appeared which is called 'group studying', but it is not common. Why most of the person study alone? In my opinion, it is because studying alone is more efficient than studying with group of students. Also, I prefer to study alone by these reasons.\n First, studying alone is the better environment to concentrate. When you study alone, it is very quiet. Otherwise, you tend to talk continuously with friends when you study with many students. Also, your eyes will sometimes go to the friends' textbook, and it will make harder to achieve the daily amount of studying. When I was high school, I have experienced both of studying method. When I studied alone, there was no problem with studying. But when I studied with friends, I was confused because friends were talking things about games, k-pops, etc. Since I realized that studying with friends are not fitting with me, I studied alone. \n Second, studying together with whom has different study speed or study routine is much harder than studying myself. For example, one student solves problem in 5 minutes, and other student solve the same problem in 15 minutes. However, another student cannot solve the problem. Then the first student will take much more than 5 minutes for going one problem because he(she) needs to make understand the last student. It is same with second student, too. This will happen at the most of the cases, and it is the main cause that drops the efficiency of studying. My math book studying rate was 1 chapter for 2 days when I studied alone. But I took 3~4 days when I studied with friends, because my friends were asking a lot of problems to me. \n\nBefore I go to high school, I thought studying with friends were also good. But studying alone had better conditions and faster studying speed. Because of these reasons, I like to study alone more.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay presents a clear opinion on the preference for studying alone over group study, but it lacks depth in supporting arguments, such as providing more varied examples or research to strengthen the claim, which is evident in the reliance on personal anecdotes like distractions from friends.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is organized into clear sections that address distinct points, such as the concentration benefits and differing study speeds, but the transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, which can disrupt the overall flow, as seen in the shift from personal experience to general statements.\nJustification for Language: The language used in the essay is generally clear, but it contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'studying with whom has different study speed,' which affects the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

They are getting to know about something; to understand what it is, taking it into memory, and applying it (for example, solving problems).\nWith this viewpoint, I prefer to study with a group of students.\n  First of all, studying with some people can help you to understand about something better. When you learn about some contents, it is inevitable to face some problems. They can be caused by misunderstanding about details, too hard contents which make you confused, and so on. When you study alone, you cannot correct those misunderstanding. Also, you cannot ask some confusing things and cannot fully understand them. When you study with your friends, you can discuss about those things. Then, you can know more about what you've learned.\n  Next, studying together is also helpful for taking things into your memory. When you study alone, the best way to memorize something is just to recite it. However, you can do some great way to memorize when you study with other people. It is teaching about something that should you memorize. When you teach about some contents, you can check whether you memorized it and whether you understood it. Also, when you talk about those things with someone, it helps you to get stronger memory. Actually, the effect of teaching for way to memorize something was demonstrated with some studies.\n  Lastly, group studying makes you apply what you learned better. You may have some experiences that you already had understood about something and memorized it, but you couldn't solve problems about it. That means you didn't know about what you should apply to that problems. With your group, you can learn how to apply, and what to apply for it. \n  As I wrote above, there are lots of benefit when you study with your group. Therefore, I think that studying with a group of students is better way for studying than studying alone.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's clear argument for group studying; however, it lacks depth, as seen in the vague statement 'When you study alone, you cannot correct those misunderstanding,' which could benefit from specific examples or evidence to strengthen the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 indicates a generally coherent structure, but the transitions between ideas could be improved, as evidenced by the abrupt shift from discussing understanding to memorization without clear linking phrases.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate given the occasional grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'the best way to memorize something is just to recite it,' which could be more effectively expressed to enhance clarity."}]}

There are two reasons supporting my opinion.\nFirst of all, we can get solutions for our questions effectively with discussion. If we study alone, maybe it is possible to more focus on individual subjects. However, There is no one who can answer to questions and when they are accumulated, it can make us give up studying earlier. For example, when I was a high school student, I often have a question while studying chemistry and biology. At each time I can't understand the concept exactly, I figured it out with asking to others and discussing with the students who have the same question with me. These always gave me fast answer.\nOn top of that, it is possible to review the concepts while studying with group. For example, while explaining to other students, we can get more precise understanding of the concept. In my case, I often help my friends with solving mathematics problem and it is also very helpful to myself since I can review the definitions and theorems which I have learned.\nTo sum up, studying with a group gives us lots of advantages since it is effective and helps us to review the concepts. For these reasons, I prefer to study with a group of students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects that while the essay presents a clear opinion on the benefits of studying in groups, it lacks depth in its reasoning, as seen in the first reason where the author states that discussing questions is effective but does not provide specific examples or evidence to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 indicates that the essay has a logical structure, yet the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly in the second paragraph where the connection between explaining concepts to others and the benefits of group study feels abrupt and underdeveloped.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is justified by the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in 'there is no one who can answer to questions,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Each of these studying methods have some advantages and disadvantages, but I prefer to study alone with several reasons. \n  To begin with, studying alone is a better way to concentrate than studying with a group of students. While studying in a group we should talk to each other. I think it is not an efficient way to study because all the students in the group have a different question. For example, let's assume that the group of students are studying for the calculus midterm. Before studying in group, students will have many questions about calculus. The question might be about some questions or about some theories. All the students in a group want to ask questions to each other and it will make a large sound. Although figuring out some questions is helpful, the sound bothers me. While, studying alone I can mark on the problems or theories that I couldn't figure it alone and ask others individually.\n  In addition, studying alone makes me to study longer than studying with a group of students. When we study in a group of students, just one person can bother others studying. I have some experience about this. When, I was in high school, I was able to choose to study alone or to study with friends in some particular time. There was a room for studying alone and also for studying in a group. Sometimes I went to a room for studying in groups. The room for studying in groups is free at talking, so some students talk about other things which is not related in study. It makes a bad mood for studying. When just one person talks about other stuff, others might stop studying and talk about it too.  Studying alone, on the other hand, I can study until I am tired. So I can spend more time studying.\n  To sum up, I prefer to study alone. I concentrate more when I study alone and I spend more hour studying when I study alone. I do not like the noise when I study. I can study using my own studying methods and it helps me memorize things.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents clear reasons for preferring to study alone, such as better concentration and longer study hours, but it lacks depth in exploring the disadvantages of studying alone, which could strengthen the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, with a logical progression of ideas; however, the transitions between points could be smoother, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing noise to personal experiences.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the generally clear expression of ideas, but issues like grammatical errors, such as 'makes me to study longer' instead of 'makes me study longer,' detract from the overall quality of the writing."}]}

I just did what teachers said, I just followed what my parents told me to. I just followed school schedule and doing hard, that was all I had to do. But after graduating from high school, my circumstances have changed. I should choose what to do in my free time. There were not many options to choose, but only two options, harder and painful one or easier and exciting one. For last 6 months, I mostly choose the latter. I played Lol in my free time not studying although I need a lot of extra work. I didn't think deeply on math and physics assignment but asked to my friends whenever I faced questions that needs focus and effort. I didn't focus on classes but I slept during the lecture. For spring semester I only choosed easier one. Then my first college vacation started, one day of my summer vacation I retrospected my spring semester. I asked myself, 'what did you do?', 'what is left now?'. I answered, 'nothing'. I realized that I lost my 4 month in kaist because I made easy choices. After that I promised myself to choose hard one whenever I have to make choices. \n 'Some prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer?', it is a easy question for me if I can tell which is hard one and which is easy one. Let's find which one is harder. Before that, I will set the boundary for meaning of study. Study should be the thing that group study is optional not the one that study together is apparently better. It means that you don't necessarily study alone also you don't necessarily study with a group. In this circumstances I think study alone is hard one and better one. Study need long term thinking which is very painful and hard but in the end that makes me stronger. Study together can share that pain with your group members , you probably think deeper than think and study alone and you might get a better score. But still I think I should choose harder one. Choosing harder one not always make your score higher and your work better, mostly opposite. But I'm sure that it makes you better and stronger and it makes your score and work higher and better in the end.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 8.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects the essay's lack of depth and clarity, exemplified by the vague statement, 'I realized that I lost my 4 month in kaist because I made easy choices,' which does not provide specific details about the consequences of those choices.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 is justified by the essay's unclear structure, as seen in the abrupt transition between personal reflections and the discussion of study preferences, making it difficult for readers to follow the author's line of reasoning.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'choosed easier one,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

It may help us to understand more. However in some cases, it may make us hard to concentrate. We can just talk with groups and play except studying. So I prefer to study with a group in some cases: group have enough knowledge to study more and they really want to study. If students in group not good enough to study certain topic, studying in group will not help us. In this situation, I can concentrate in studying more when I study alone. On the other hand. we have big problem or project to solve, we can't study about it alone. We must share ideas and discuss with other students in group. For example, I was in urp program and my teammate helped each other. We can learn more with talking with each other. But when I tried to study final exam with friends, we just played when we meet.

For example, using zoom to discuss about some topics with lots of people, study alone with books, and learn new things from teachers. There are also more methods to study efficiently, but I think the most important thing to consider about their study habit is whether they prefer to study alone or prefer to study with a group of students. In my opinion, I prefer to study with many people for some reasons.\n First of all, if you have some curious things, you can ask them to your group members as soon as possible. When you studied alone, you must have experienced that you cannot solve some difficult problems. In this situation, you should have waited until you meet teachers or friends. However, if you study with your friends, you can ask them to your friends and get answer directly.\n For the next reason, it is helpful for you to answer your group members' questions. Why? For example, you have to know some theories and background information to solve math problems. When you're solving your friends' questions, you can remind theories and information related to that questions again. It means you can study one more time with your friends. Don't you think it is helpful to you?\n Finally, study with your group members make you to concentrate better than study alone. About three years ago, I asked my friends, \"When you study with your freinds, Don't you feel that you concentrate better than study alone?\". Almost all of my friends said, \"Of course. We can help each other, but we can feel that we are racing together, too.\" We can be not only teachers to each other but also rivals to each other. Because of this thinking, we can concentrate more on study to win my friends.\n In short, we can ask our questions directly, it is helpful for us to answer friends' questions, and we can concentrate more when we study with a group of students. I think this topic can be really hard to answer because these methods have their advantages. I want many students to experience both of the methods and find the way that fits them better. If they find the right way for them, good results will naturally follow them.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified because the essay provides several relevant reasons for preferring group study, such as the ability to ask questions quickly, but it lacks a deeper exploration of potential drawbacks of group study, which could enhance the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is warranted as the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, although the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly in the flow from one reason to the next.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 reflects some clarity in expression, yet grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'make you to concentrate better' and 'ask them to your friends,' detract from the overall quality of the writing."}]}

There are people who prefer studying alone. Studying alone has some advantages such as possibility to focus on the point and to develop the skills of studying. However, I prefer studying alone because of the two benefits, possibility to notice errors and encouraged studying by others.\n  First of all, I can know what I knew incorrectly by studying in group. When we study in groups, we usually discus each other about the knowledge we know. In this process, individuals talk about what they know about the topic. When someone says the incorrect information other will argue that one is wrong, and they will argue about that point. Because they are in group, usually person who said wrong point will understand that he or she was wrong, so he or she can correctly know about that point, and this is important in learning something. I believe correcting one wrong knowledge is better than learning three new knowledge but finding out what I know incorrectly is too hard to do alone. Therefore, I think it is a huge advantage to notice errors in studying, so this is the one reason I prefer studying in group.\n More importantly, I can focus on studying better when I study in group. When I study alone, I often loss my concentration during study, and do some other things which are not related to studying. However, studying in group helped me prevent losing concentration because other people are studying and I care that they can watch at me. I realized this effect when I was in high school. At my high school, many students study together in the same room and we can also use the small rooms if the student wants to study alone. I used to study alone at the first time, but I could not study well. Therefore I tried using the big room studying in groups of students. After changing the studying type, I could fully focus on my studying, and the grade became better too. Because I experience how studying in group can change my concentration, I know that is the best way of studying way for me.\n To sum up, studying together in group seems much efficent than studying alone for me because of the advantage in correcting wrong knowledge and more concentration earned. I have experience these benefits when I studied to attend KAIST, and I am sure that studying in group can help me achieve bigger goals in my life of studying. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the author states, 'I think it is a huge advantage to notice errors in studying,' but fails to provide specific examples or evidence to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the presence of distinct paragraphs, yet the flow is hindered by awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing error correction to concentration without a clear linking statement.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted by the overall clarity of expression, although issues like 'loss my concentration' instead of 'lose my concentration' indicate some grammatical inaccuracies that detract from the overall quality."}]}

There are three reasons.\n   First, I can be inspired by others. When I study alone, I usually can't concentrate on studying. But when I study with a group of students, I can see other people who study and think that I should study hard too. So, It can make good result to each other. For example I didn't study much because I always be alone. However I could study well when I participate study group with ZOOM. It's very helpful for me.\n   Second, I can ask what I can't understand and explain what others don't know. Most people can't understand every thing, but they can't ask or discuss when they study alone. Then they should search internet, send e-mail to professors and so on. It takes more time. I can save my time by asking to study group members. Also explaining to others makes me understand the knowledge better and get skills of explaining. I explained a lots when I was highschool students, it was more helpful than when I studied alone at that time. Someone says it is unhelpful, but it's not true. And opinion of many people helps me to think diverse ways about knowledge.\n   Finally, I can make new friends and they may help me at future. Knowing a lot of people is important in society because people can't live alone. Studying group members study same subjects, so most of them would have same dream. It's likely to work together not only now. Then experience of doing a group studying should make us feel friendly. Not only this case, working with diverse kinds of people helps me when I participate other group working, work at company and so on. I think it is good experience if they don't give much advantages to studying. For instance, a frined who study chemistry with me at highschool takes this class together and gives many help each other.\nTo sum up, studying with a group of students helps me get concentrate on studying well, understand the knowledges more, and make new helpful friends. For these reasons, I think studying with a group of students is better than studying alone.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a strength in the explanation of the benefits of group study, such as the ability to ask questions and gain diverse perspectives, but it is weakened by a lack of depth in examples, as seen in the vague phrasing 'a frined who study chemistry with me at highschool takes this class together and gives many help each other.'\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay with distinct reasons presented in separate paragraphs, yet it suffers from awkward transitions and some repetitive phrasing, as demonstrated in the transition from discussing saving time to the point about making friends, which could be more fluid.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to the use of generally clear language and an attempt at varied sentence structure, but it is hindered by multiple grammatical errors, such as 'I explained a lots when I was highschool students,' which detracts from overall clarity and professionalism."}]}

There are obviously many opinions regarding this prompt. For example, some people assert that students should study many subjects which include less interested subjects for integration, ~~~~. But it is evident that students specialize in one subject is more beneficial than study many subjects lightly for the following concepts of deep understanding, efficiency, and choice of job.\nFirst, students can deeply understand the major subject. Unless they spend their entire time studying many subjects separately, they can participate in the active learning, which includes long-term activiteisuch as the discussion or their own research of specific topic. Since, students use various methods of studying, students receive background information or advanced information ~\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 to class, students who concentrate one subjects can understand the contents of the subject remarkably. In addition, advanced information which is earned by the active learning helps to backthinking basic concept. \nSecond, students can study efficiently when they specialize one subject. In most cases, the student who wants to specialize the specific major enjoys knowing new topics and theories. Therefore, they can not only understand new theories more fast but also apply the theories to the problems more accurate. These talents and abilities should be specialized by the universities' class. \nFinally, students can easily get a job by appearing their expertise. If they even finish the graduate school, the firm may consider you as developing your own field for a long time, and may believe your ability and technology more than people who widely took classes in many subjects in their undergraduate. Therefore, many firms want to choose you for firms' development.\nIn conclusion, students should concentrate to one major for active understanding through various learning activities, efficiency caused by your interest, and expanding choice of job. Specializing in one subject is very important for increasing your own unique value in our societies. But, we should also be careful to have a narrow thinking.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's focus on the benefits of specializing in one subject, but the argument is weakened by unclear and incomplete phrases such as 'which include less interested subjects for integration, ~~~~,' which detracts from the overall clarity and persuasiveness of the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear structure with distinct paragraphs for each main point; however, the transition between ideas could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing deep understanding to efficiency without a smooth transition.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'students specialize in one subject is more beneficial' and 'students can study efficiently when they specialize one subject,' which impede the overall readability and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Although some people argue that students have to learn about only a specific subject, I believe that university requires students to take classes in various subject is nice for the following reasons.\nTo begin with, most of student don't know which subject is proper to them. By taking classes in many subjects, students can experience various subjects and find their interest in one of those subjects. It would help students to decide their major and job. In my case, I didn't have enough time to determine major when I was high-school student, because the goal of my high school life is entering famous university. However, I entered KAIST which requires students to take classes in various major then I learn about 3 majors. Now, I decide my main major and it is very proper to me. Thus, taking classes in many subjects can give these advantages \nOn top of that, student can obtain wide knowledge from each subjects. Since the society becomes more complex, people need to study widely than before. Wide knowledge help people to work on various fields and reduce the restriction of major to take job. These days, the ratio of people who change their job increases so student must prepare to this change. For example, google, the large IT company in U.S, want to employ the programmers who are good at either programming and discussion. \nTo sum up, taking classes in many subjects help student to determine their major and get wide knowledge. In this regard, I think that university should require students to take classes in various subjects.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's strength in presenting a personal example of how taking various classes helped the author determine their major, but it lacks depth in addressing counterarguments or exploring the broader implications of a diverse education.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with an identifiable introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion, although the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly when shifting from personal experience to general benefits.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate due to the generally clear expression of ideas; however, grammatical errors such as 'most of student' instead of 'most students' demonstrate a weakness that slightly detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Regarding this issue, some people might say that student must study many subjects because it can make students much more powerful than study one subject. However, I believe that specializing in one subject is more efficient then study many subjects.\n First of all, if students specialize in one subject, they can do various experience. Compare time between students to specialize in one subject and take many subjects, it is clear that student who study one subject have many time. This make students have various chances. Student can participate exchange students and study at famous university in other country, or they can join company to learn how to apply their knowledge. This experiences make students better. \n Further, it is true that studying one subject is efficient because they can graduate earlier. People's age is very significant at competition. However, if student study many major, it is hard to graduate in 4 years. In KAIST many student study multiple major. However, many students who study multiple major graduate at 5 years. This is because they have to take other major classes. However, in other university, many students graduate in 4 years because they study one major. In fact, 1 year can make difference at competition because many company want young person. Therefore, specialize in one subject is more efficient then take classes in many subjects.\n Finally, some people might think that study many subjects must helpful to students because they can build their multi capacity. However, this is not true. For example, in Korea University, student must study another major to graduate. However, my friends in Korea University say that it is not efficient. He think that this politics make them can not focus on their own major. He always busy because he have to study two major course and he cannot understand perfectly because he don't have enough time to study. This example clearly shows that study many subjects is not efficient at all.\n In conclusion, students specialize in one subject are better than students take classes in many subjects because they have enough time to do other experience, they can graduate earlier, and studying many subjects is not efficient. For the three reasons mentioned above, I strongly believe that specializing one subject is much more efficient then studying many subjects.  \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects a strong argument for specializing in one subject, but it is weakened by the lack of specific examples supporting the claim, such as the vague references to 'various chances' and 'various experience' without elaboration.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion; however, the transitions between points could be improved for better flow, particularly between the first and second paragraphs.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted due to a generally clear expression of ideas, but it is diminished by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'student take classes' and 'this politics make them can not focus,' which hinder clarity."}]}

Some students thinks that this policy is disturbing students' right to choose the major and making experts, but this policy is the best way for students in parts of experience, ability.\n\n By studying in various major, students can experience lots of knowledge that can help them to decide their future, These days, many high school students study for their college not for their life's goal, so many students don't know what they really want to be. In this situation, how can students choose their major, which is directly related to their future jobs. and become specialize in that part. However, studying in different majors and having experiences about expert knowledge can help them to decide about their goal in life by letting students know about what they like and be good at. \n\n Also those experience in different major will help students accessing to the solution of problems in different ways. Since robot and machine technology are developing these days, many workplaces requires creativity to their employers because they don't need blue power any more. Therefore students have to think in different way compare to others to become successful in their society work and their various experience and knowledge will give them many viewpoints of the problem compare to those who are specialized in the one major.\n\n Some people say that if students study various things, they can't become experts in various parts. Of course, they can't, but society don't need experts anymore since there are lots of knowledge that can be easily found cause of developed information devices. So the important point is creativity not expert knowledge as shown in other paragraphs. As the technology improving, the one major experts become more needless since AI or the Internet can replace them.\n\n Consequently, the development of technology makes great change in our society and work place. In the past, many work places required experts, but these days they need more creative people.

Some people think that letting students to take various classes and to have knowledge on various subjects is the ideal education, and some just think that specializing in one subject is the best. These opinions about education affect to each universities' decision about education and give severe effects on each university's students. There are many discussions about this, and mostly, this depends on the goal of education. Although some think shallow and wide education on various subjects is the ideal way of university education, it is actually true that specializing in one subject is better. There are mainly 2 reasons supporting this.\n\nFirst, it is because unlike middle school or high school, university is not suitable for the place doing various experience. Most of the students look for a job right after graduating university. It means that, in the age of graduation, the student should have specialized techniques or experience that would seem attractive to the company which they want to apply. Shallow knowledge caused by taking various classes won't give specialized technique to students and this will cause negative affect on students. Some people say that various experiences will give better insight to students, the truth is that this does not give any good effect on application for companies since it doesn't give any specialized techniques.\n\nSecond, it is because forcing students to take various subjects might make students lose their interest on studying. Some students are very bad at specific subjects even thought they are very good at other subjects. And forcing these students to take classes that they don't like might make them lose their interest on studying. Some might think it is essential to gain various information to become a better scholar, but if it takes student's interest about studying, that it will be the worst occasion.\n\nThere is no exact answer for the direction of the education. It can vary from culture to culture, nation to nation, or even people to people. But it is still true that in the boundary of university education, specializing in one subject is much better than taking various subjects since it will seem more attractive to employers when students are getting hired, and to avoid students losing interest on studying.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects the essay's clear argument that specializing in one subject is preferable, but it lacks depth in supporting examples, such as failing to elaborate on the specific skills or techniques that employers seek.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with an introduction and two main points, although the transition between ideas could be smoother, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing the job market to student interest.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate due to generally clear expression, but it contains several grammatical errors, such as 'affect to each universities' decision,' which detracts from the overall clarity of the argument."}]}

Some people insist that this method of education is a kind of waste of time because concentrated education is the most efficient way to raise specialized workers. In contrast, I strongly argue that taking classes in \nmany different subjects is better way for education. This essay will justify my opinion with several reasons.\n    At first, a lot of study of current day are done by not just one subject but more than two subjects at least. For example, most of economics study are performed with advanced physics models. Therefore, lots of economics study project prefer people who studied physics and economics to people who just studied economics. This effect appears in every areas. As a result, because university must raise students who are attractive to industries, it is better way to educate students.\n    Moreover, students who take classes in many subjects can communicate with other people more effectively. For instance, a person who studied math classes and physics classes can perform a conservation with another physicist more effectively than a person who just studied math classes. It is a role of universities to raise students who can communicate with people who are in different area. Therefore, it is better way to educate students.\n    However, some people insist that taking classes in many subject is a kind of waste of time. They think university education period is short and universities should raise completed students in specified area. In contrast, I think that university education is not the end of education. Universities do not have to raise completed students. It is more important to raise students who can communicate with other people who are in different area.\n    In summary, I insist that taking classes in many different subjects is better way for students because it can help students to be attractive to industries and communicate with people. Of course, someone can think that it is a waste of time, but I think universities do not have to raise completed students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument in favor of taking classes in various subjects, but it lacks depth in examples, such as the vague reference to 'a lot of study of current day' without specific studies or data to support the claims made.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is warranted because the essay has a logical structure with clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion, but transitions between ideas could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift between discussing the benefits of diverse subjects and addressing counterarguments.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate since the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and sentence structure, yet it contains several grammatical errors, such as 'a lot of study of current day are done' instead of 'a lot of studies today are done,' which detracts from clarity."}]}

Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nSince humans have different backgrounds, humans cannot fully understand each other. This lack of understanding occurs some debating among humans. In that point, specializing or not is one of the most interesting issue among people in universities. Some people argue that students need to be specialized in one subject, not take classes in many subjects. However, there are also people who argue that students need to take classes in many subjects, not specializing in one subject. Both sides are very logical, but I think that specializing in one subject is better than taking classes in many subjects. \n\n First, humans do not need people normal techniques. Nowadays, internet is widely opened to people in entire world. People who want technology can get information from the internet because people can update their technology on the internet. This made people to be familiar with technologies. However, the problem happens after this. Since people became familiar with technologies, they do not need people with normal technologies because they can get the information of normal technologies from the internet. Then, people with normal technologies do not have any properties because people do not need people with normal technologies. This is also true for people with normal technologies at wide area. Students taking classes in many subjects will be humans with normal technologies. Although they can cover wide area of problem, it does not matter to their properties. They will become useless. However, think of the people with specialized technologies. People with specialized technologies do not need to worry about their properties because people with specialized technologies are rare in their area. The reason why they are rare in their area is related to their subjects. Since they are specialized in their subjects, they need to spend enormous time so they cannot spend time for other subjects. This investment of their subjects makes the people with specialized technologies rare. Therefore, students need to specialize in one subject, not take classes in many subjects.\n\nSecond, specializing is essential to the development. The development of science is from the specializing. Specializing has made our technologies. People with normal techniques but can cover wide area cannot develop the technology because their result is just specialized technologies. They can develop their technologies, but the developed technologies are already developed by the people who specialized in one subject. In short, they are just following the people with specialized technology. Therefore, to develop their technology, students need to specialize in one subject, not taking classes in many subjects.\n\nLastly, taking classes in many subjects is just removing their money. Students in universities do not need to take classes in many subjects, because the information from the classes can be found at other platforms like Youtube. For example, in KAIST, there are a class that learns about the data structures of JAVA. However, the topic is also in the Youtube, because it is normal technology. However, there is no classes about the experiment about molecules at other platforms because it is one of the specialized technology. Students cannot learn about specialized technologies but can learn about normal technologies. Therefore, students need to specialize in one subject, not taking classes in many subjects.\n\nSome people would argue that taking classes in many subjects are better than specialize one subject because using many subjects they can mix many technologies and produce other technologies. However, I argue that specializing is better.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's argument that specializing in one subject is preferable, but it is weakened by vague reasoning, such as the claim that 'students taking classes in many subjects will be humans with normal technologies,' which lacks clear evidence and coherence.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion; however, the transitions between ideas could be smoother, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing technology to the financial implications of taking multiple classes.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'humans do not need people normal techniques' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nNowadays, there exist different points of view about subjects in universities; taking classes in many subjects or specializing in one subject. Some people think it is better to be specialized in one subject, because concentration to one subject makes student be expert in the field. However, I think it is better to take classes in many subjects for following reasons; finding what they really like, wide thinking and \n  First of all, students can find the subject that they really like. In the process of applying to universities, every student in Korea have to choose their major rely on what they have learned in primary, middle and high school. Although there exist many subjects from primary to high school, the important thing is that it is not exactly what students want to learn. Entering universities, students can choose what to learn from hundreds of classes. In this environment, students get to take classes which they have wanted to hear or they have never experienced. Students have high possibility to find the field that fit to them. Specializing in one subject will not give students these kinds of experience and students will just believe what they are learning is what they are mostly like and good at.\n  Taking classes in many subjects is good for students not only in personal satisfaction, but also in their wide thoughts. One of the key aspects of 4th industrial revolution is mixture of the fields. For example, one of the main technique of 4th industrial revolution, IoT requires not only excellent computing but also knowledge about machine, even knowledge about user's minds. Also, in the process of attracting consumers to use certain item, people tend to view design as one of the most important aspects of devices. Therefore, mixture of knowledge from many fields leads to wide thinking and better item that fits to needs of contemporary people.\n  Last but not least, students can make friends in various majors. One different point of life in university from life in high school is that students do not have to be concentrate only in study. Rather, students can do activities that can improve themselves or work on various activities with friends such as events or group activities. In this process, students who hang out with various type of friends have higher possibility to think one problem in various views. However, if they only have to hang out with friends with similar thoughts in same majors, their thought can be narrowed down.\n  In conclusion, I think it is better to take classes in many subjects because students can find the subject that they really like, have wider thoughts and make various type of friends. Taking classes in many subjects is one of the significant thing in universities compared to other schools and they would better utilize this chance.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects the essay's strength in presenting the argument for taking classes in many subjects, such as the point about finding a subject students really like, but it lacks depth in discussing how this exploration translates into long-term benefits for students.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct introductory, body, and concluding paragraphs; however, the transition from personal satisfaction to the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge could be smoother, as seen in the abrupt shift between ideas.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate given the generally clear expression of ideas, yet there are grammatical errors, such as 'students can find the subject that they really like' which detracts from the overall fluency and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nThere are many students in KAIST who think between taking classes in many subjects for fusion and specializing in one subject for getting strength in one field. I think that specializing in one subject is better than taking classes in many subjects. There are three reasons for my opinion.\n\nFirst of all, if we take classes in many subjects, we cannot have a lower specialty in one field. For example, in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering, all students are taught about the introduction of chemistry, physics, and biology. It may seem good, but many students can't get depth knowledge about any one field of science. So, it eventually can make students lose their force to perform strong studies, and lose at competing among other science major students.\n\nMoreover, specializing in even one subject is very hard for university students. According to my lab professor, there are many students to do double major for achieving fusion between two major. However, he said that there are also many students that miss their core major subject since they are so busy to take other major classes to get a title of double major. So, he advised that concentrating on one subject is much better than taking classes in many subjects. And in his empirical, it is said that students who study one subject in depth usually do better performance in graduate school.\n\nFinally, students who specialize in one subject can get a better opportunity in the field of industry. Compared to the students who take classes in many subjects, they have a bigger possibility to solve an industrial problem because they have a higher understanding of one field. So, they will catch more opportunity to revise an industrial problem.\n\nFor these reasons, I think that specializing in one subject has more strength than taking classes in many subjects. Although the students who specialize in one subject may be hard to fusion two subjects, I think that the fusion of the two subjects is possible for students who already specialize in one field. So, as I mentioned before, specializing in one subject is better.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay states that 'if we take classes in many subjects, we cannot have a lower specialty in one field,' which is a vague assertion that lacks strong supporting evidence and examples.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, as it effectively presents an introduction, followed by three distinct reasons supporting the main argument, although the transition between ideas could be smoother.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 indicates some issues with clarity and grammar, as seen in the phrase 'it eventually can make students lose their force to perform strong studies,' which is awkwardly constructed and could confuse readers."}]}

Some people argue that digging one pond is good and even focusing on one subject is not easy. But, I would like to claim that students should take classes in many subjects rather than one subject.\n\nWe can have many advantages by taking classes in many subjects. First, We can gain various knowledge and technology in many subjects. In KAIST, all freshman students have to take the various classes in many subjects to graduate KAIST. It means that taking different subject classes is helpful since KAIST graduators have done a great job on various areas. Also, these various classes can help to understand our subjects by connecting points.\nIn addition to the first reason, cooperation (working together) is most important features in today. To work with another person, it is good to take classes in many subjects. For example, if we are studying for integrating parts,  then it is obvious that all people know the parts of other person's major is effective since we do not need to teach others.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many good points of taking many different major classes such as various knowledge and cooperation ability. So, it is clear that universities should require students to take classes in many subjects rather than on subject.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 is justified because while the essay presents the argument for taking classes in many subjects, it lacks depth and specific examples, such as a more detailed exploration of how diverse knowledge impacts career opportunities.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is warranted as the essay has a basic structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between ideas are weak, particularly in the second paragraph where the shift from discussing knowledge to cooperation feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 reflects the essay's use of some correct phrases, but it suffers from grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as the sentence 'To work with another person, it is good to take classes in many subjects,' which could be more clearly stated."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nThere are still controversies about universities should require students to take classes in many subjects or to specialize in one subject. Among them, some people say that students should specialize in one factor to be more specialized person and to have high-level thinking. However, I think students should be required to take classes in many subjects for following three reasons. \n\nTo the begin with, when students take classes in many topics and subjects, combining two or more of subjects could be easier for them and can have additional knowledge. In recent days, there are many research topics that combines two or more topics and requires the knowledge of other subjects. In addition, there are cases that knowing only one specific area is not sufficient to resolve the required problem. For instance, sometimes, designing and computing is required for mathematics when researchers should have to found optical way in problem solving. \n\nSecond, it is much easier to contract and communicate with people in other area when students get their jobs. When students have carrier in the future, they will meet many peoples in many parts. To communicate and have a talk with them, students should have to learn and research about the language of the other area to understand specific contents. For example, the students who have learned about mathematics can contact with computer scientist to make formula about society communication and develop the platform. However, if they don't know each other's subject and language, the communication must be much difficult for them and will need more time for them to explaining to each other, which is not an efficient way. In addition, they both should study about the contents about the society if they don't know about it too. \n\nLastly, students can have more creative thinking, if they can learn majority of subjects in the university. The word 'creativity' is often thought as a 'new' or 'fascinating' ideas. These thinking can be brought when someone combines one area with another area that nobody considered before. For instance, Davinchi had found many things ny\n\nIn conclusion, I think specializing in one area might have advantages for some students. However, learning the other subjects might have more benefits for the students because students can have additional knowledge be combining two areas, can be much easier to contact and communicate with other area people, and can have more creative thinking. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects the essay's overall argument for the benefits of taking classes in multiple subjects, but it lacks depth in examples, as shown by the incomplete thought in the sentence discussing Da Vinci, which undermines the strength of the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with a logical progression of ideas; however, the transition between points could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from the second point to the third without a clear connecting sentence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate due to the essay's generally clear expression of ideas, but it contains several grammatical errors, such as 'to the begin with' instead of 'to begin with,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

In South Korea, there are four word historical words, \"\ub2e4\ub2e4\uc775\uc120\", it means more resource will make better result. So, we can interprete take multiple subjects is better. \n\nFirst, it will get advantages for our nation.

In KAIST, every student is required to take variety of subjects in their first year even if the department they want to go to is decided already. There might be some people who believe that taking classes in many subjects is good to be able to acquire various knowledge and helps to decide the department . However, I disagree with the above idea and agree with the idea that specializing in one subject is better for the following reasons: It can increases students' major expertise , and students can get more time planning their future after graduation.\n\n One of the most essential reasons is professionalism in major. Fields of interest to the student themselves usually occur before entering university. \nEven if I see my friends around me, there are no friends who have completely changed their interests after admission. The advantage for specialize in one subject is that you can greatly increase your knowledge of your major.\n\n Second, student can graduate ealier, which gives us ample time to plan your future It's common for UK universities to go to various companies to intern in their fourth year after three years of intensive major education. I think that it is possible because the curriculum that emphasizes majors rather than requiring students' knowledge in many fields. Actually, KAIST requires students to take many liberal arts and various subjects, so many students graduate in 5 years.\n\n In contrast to my side, many people still claim that taking classes in many subjects is helpful for getting various knowledge; however, I still believe that it is not true. Since there are some differences between what we learn in college and the actual situation, I think it is more efficient to specialize in major education for 4 years.\n\n\n In conclusion, these are the reason\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified because while the essay presents a clear argument against taking classes in various subjects, it lacks concrete examples and evidence to support the claim that specializing increases knowledge, such as specific fields where this has proven beneficial.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by the logical flow of ideas, although the conclusion is abruptly cut off with 'these are the reason,' which detracts from the overall coherence and completeness of the essay.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects a generally clear expression of ideas, but the presence of grammatical errors, such as 'advantage for specialize in one subject,' indicates a need for improvement in language use."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nPeople have different points of view about the diversity of subjects students take. For example, some universities require students to take classes in many subjects whereas there are some others that require students to specialize in one subject. Universities which prefer specialized students in one subject argue that focusing on one subject has the advantage of having better expertise. Although the idea of \"Deep and narrow is better than shallow and wide\" is true, I prefer students to take classes in many subjects for two reasons.\n\n  First, all subjects are connected. Students cannot succeed just because they are good at math, and students cannot succeed just because they are good at physics. When it is time to utilize the subjects students have learned, they should eventually integrate them with other subjects. For example, suppose a student only learned mechanical engineering. This student has no knowledge other than mechanical engineering, and he wants to participate in robotics research, a branch of mechanical engineering. However, since robotics is also very closely linked to biology, this student will have a lot of difficulties in the research process.\n\n  Second, students don't know which subject is suit for them. Most majors and subjects are determined when students graduate from high school and enter university. However, young students at this time are still inexperienced and don't know exactly what they will learn in college. Universities should provide these students with more opportunities to experience and set up a system to take various subjects.  \n\n  In conclusion, because of the connectivity of subjects and the instability of young students due to lack of experience, universities should encourage students to take various subjects. A number of students change the subjects they are learning and taking at university. Universities should reduce the time wasted unnecessarily by students' wrong choice of subjects.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 5.0/5\nLanguage: 5.0/5\nOverall Score: 14.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score is 4.5/5 because the essay effectively presents the argument for taking diverse subjects, supported by examples such as the challenge a mechanical engineering student might face in robotics due to a lack of interdisciplinary knowledge, although it could benefit from more specific examples or evidence to strengthen the argument further.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score is 5.0/5 as the essay is well-structured with a clear introduction, two distinct supporting points, and a cohesive conclusion that effectively summarizes the main argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score is 5.0/5 due to the use of clear and effective language throughout the essay, as seen in the phrase 'deep and narrow is better than shallow and wide', which succinctly conveys the author's point about expertise versus breadth of knowledge."}]}

There are many universities in the world, and their types are all different. In some universities, they require taking multiple classes to graduate; on the other hand, other universities require learn a single major deeply. In my thought, learning multiple majors in the university is more helpful for students for some reasons.\n The most important reason why I argues for taking classes in many subject is contemporary world requires knowledge about many things. In a century ago, there are many subjects to do study, and we just need knowledge abut that. However, in nowadays, it has been harder and harder to work only in one major; instead, they have to get an idea from different field. In this perspective, taking multiple majors because it can make our view larger. For example, algebra and geometry look like different field of mathematics, but they can work with each other by using coordinates.\n Following to the first reason, sometimes we have to use other field's knowledge to do our study. For example, statistics are used for many fields. Even biology, and some majors in social studies requires knowledge about statistics to work. In this case, someone who majored mathematics can do a study fluently.\n Despite of these reasons, some people argues that specializing in a subject is better because taking classes in multiple subjects is less professional in the main major. However, we can collaborate with others, to make a better idea. Collaboration with people in other fields making a new knowledge that never exists before. In this case, knowledge about other's field can help talking and collaborate with each other.\n  By taking these reasons, requiring students to take classes in multiple majors is helpful for students because it helps making new ideas, working with the study, and collaborating with other. Nowadays, collaboration is the most important to make a new knowledge, and teaching multiple subjects allows us to make pioneers of our future.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument in favor of taking multiple majors, but it lacks depth in examples, such as failing to elaborate on how collaboration leads to new knowledge, which weakens the overall argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay follows a logical structure with an introduction, supporting points, and a conclusion, but the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly between the second and third paragraphs.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the essay's generally clear expression, though grammatical errors, such as 'I argues' instead of 'I argue,' and awkward phrases like 'knowledge about other's field' detract from the overall clarity and professionalism."}]}

Even if some people insist that take classes about one subject is better choice. I personally prefer that take diverse subjects for the following two reasons.   \n    To begin with, knowing about various field is helpful. we face uncountable situation in life. To solve this situation, we need to know about not only one specific subjects but also other field. My personal experience is a compelling illustration of this. I learned Japanese when I was young. At that time, I thought there was no reason to speak Japanese at all, but thanks to learning Japanese, I was able to answer questions when I met a Japanese at an amusement park.\n    In contrast to opinion that take diverse subjects is better choice, many people still claim that take classes about one subject because if we study many things, we may not be able to do anything right. However, because each subject is linked, studying other subjects also helps to understand another subject. For instance, though I like only physics, I studied overall physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science because I went to science high school. However, In studying, I notice that the thermodynamics of physics and chemistry are similar and physics was used a lot in earth science.\n    In conclusion, I strongly argue that learning about many subjects is better than specializing in one subject because learning various subject is helpful for both to solve the problem which we will face and to understand other subjects. Considering the two reasons discussed above, it is clear that taking classes in many subjects is more helpful.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear preference for taking diverse subjects, supported by personal experience, such as the author's ability to communicate in Japanese, but it lacks depth in exploring additional examples or counterarguments.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by a logical structure that includes an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but the transition between ideas could be improved, especially in phrases like 'In contrast to opinion that take diverse subjects is better choice,' which is awkwardly phrased.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 reflects the presence of several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, such as 'take one specific subject and take classes in many subjects,' which detracts from the overall clarity and flow of the essay."}]}

Some people argue that taking lectures only related to their major is crucial because that's more efficient to learn. However, I regard taking various range of classes is important based on the following reasons. \n\nThe first reason is that the students can find their interests by taking classes in various subjects. For example, many of Kaist students who can take other subjects which is unrelated to their own major frequently change their major. Many students can find their own interests by taking different categories of lectures.\n\nThe second reason is that taking many classes can help students to get practical advice. Learning the knowledge related to not only the major but also the liberal acts is important. For example, the students who took the \"Modern war and conflict\" lecture can learn how to live to avoid and solve the conflict. These kinds of knowledge are crucial for real life, but it is not able to learn from their major classes.\n\nSomeone argues that takes the lectures only related to their major is important for the professionality. However, it is not true because learning from the classes which is not related to the major also helps them. The doctor who treated the cancer which is almost impossible to care said that he can treat the patient from the book telling the way of how to beat the war. It proves some important idea which can change the world is originated from totally different things.\n\nTo sum up, Taking numerous lectures is crucial taking account of finding their interests and getting the practical advice.

This essay argue about the three point that why university need to take many subjects; effective study, effective evaluation, fewer risk.\n\nFirst, many subjects can help effective study. University students almost do not spend a lot of time to study because there are so many things to do. And they usually start the subjects right before the deadline. If some classes give one subject to students in each semester, they may study the subject just one time. Even they could study about just one part of the lectures which is relative to that subject. This is never effective way to increase their knowledge. Students need to study with a cycle, and various subjects help them. \n\nSecond, evaluate student with just one subject is not a good way. In one lecture, they learn a lot of thing and each students have their own interesting. For example, let's assume that student A is interested in chapter 1 and not good at chapter 2. And professor give a subject about chapter 2. Maybe, A is going to get a lower score than his ability. Therefore, universities need to evaluate various ability in students with a many subject.\n\nFinally, many subject decrease the risk. There are unpredictable situations in our lives. Before the deadline, students can get damage on their product, or computer viruses, emergency situation, and so on. Following reasons, some students cannot complete their mission in time. If there is just one big subject, the risk is so high. Many separable subjects protect students from these bad situations. \n\nIn conclusion, because many subjects bring effective study, effective evaluation, fewer risk, university need to make many subjects in a class. Some people think one subject is much more simple. So some students may feel stressful about a lot of subject, but they will satisfy about it in the future.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects a lack of depth in supporting arguments, as seen in the statement 'this is never effective way to increase their knowledge,' which is vague and does not provide specific examples or evidence to substantiate the claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, but the transition between ideas is weak, particularly in the phrase 'Following reasons,' which does not clearly link the previous point to the discussion about risk.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'evaluate student with just one subject is not a good way,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

So almost of high school students go university and there are many universities in world. The principles of education are various by universities. The main educational argument among universities is 'taking classes in many subject vs specializing in one subject.' . Although some people claim that specializing in one subject is better for students, I believe that taking classes in many subject brings more good educational effect to students. There are several reasons of that.\n  First learning various subject can give students the opportunity to find things they ever knew. Many students in high school, particularly in Korea don't have much time to find what they like , what they want to do in future, and what kind of potential ability they have. Their interests and potential ability only can be found by many directly doing. University, which have many exerted professor is best place to give that abiity.\n  Second They can make friends in another department. If students only learn their one major. They don't have enough chance to meet friends in another department. Making different people who major another field is very precious thing in one's life. Because it opens one's eyes to larger world and it improves one's ability to communicate other people. Communication ability is necessary for these society.\n  In despite of these reasons, some people says that studying one subject enough and is more important to students, because of there are many things to learn in just one major and four year is not enough time to master it. It is right. However the these days society really want for people is not perfectly knowing alone but ability to communicate each other. And also there are advanced school.\n In conclusion, opportunity to find their covered abilities and interests and to make various friends is\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects a solid argument in favor of taking classes in many subjects, but the lack of specific examples to support this claim, such as the mention of diverse career paths that could arise from a broader educational experience, weakens the overall persuasiveness of the essay.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion; however, the abrupt ending without a complete conclusion detracts from its overall coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'company needs high ability to young people' and 'the these days society really want for people,' which hinder clarity and fluency."}]}

It was an organization for research, the only source of breakthrough. Then companies with mass capital setup their own research facilities, leading new breakthroughs. Time by time, universities became concentrated at education more than research. Also the educational requirements of workplaces generally increased, several small universities were even considered as a place for job training. Nowadays, numbers of universities are facing new problems caused by upcoming changes in this rapid developing technology civilization. If they could not handle new requirements, they will not be able to evade termination. Universities must give students diversity in their subjects to flexibly deal with those problems.\n The first reason why universities should offer diverse subject's educations to the students is the rapid changing workplace. For example, product designers have to know what digital circuitry is needed to make sure the design with LEDs or digital interfaces can possibly operate. Even if they doesn't know deeply about electronics, at least they should know it's possible or not. Programmers working for web sites are required to have knowledge in art and design. Those requirements did not exist in last centuries, but it is becoming essential. \n Even though, there are several opinions that diversity in educations lower the quality of itself. However, this is restricted on a specific portions of diverse jobs, such as researcher. In a situation that adapting to new job requirements is required, spending time on one subject causes the students to lose their possible chances for practical job educations. Also, most of the students enter universities without knowing what they really want to do. University is now treated as a place for finding job preferences.\n In conclusion, the change of workplaces require new workers armed with diverse knowledge. Universities should follow this trend to offer students new diverse educations that they need. Being specialized on a few subjects causes risk of loosing time for this era's students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's presentation of relevant ideas, such as the need for diverse subject offerings in universities to adapt to changing job markets, but it lacks depth and specific examples, as seen in the vague mention of 'several small universities' without elaboration on their role or impact.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the essay's overall structure, which includes a clear introduction and conclusion; however, it suffers from weak transitions between ideas, particularly in the second paragraph where the shift from product designers to programmers lacks coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate given the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'those requirements did not exist in last centuries,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nAll over the world, university students have to choose between taking many subjects or specializing in on major. Some people argue that one major is more efficient because through that, university students can become a specialist of their major. Of course, this idea is true, but I regard that taking many subjects is more important based on the following reasons.\n  First, by taking more courses, students can find their interest in those courses. Knowing what they want to study and research at once rarely happens because it is difficult for students to know their interests in subjects before they study those subjects. In KAIST, one of Korean university, runs a special freshman program, which is actually choosing a major after freshman semester. students can select and take lectures by themselves. Then, after their freshman year, they choose their majors based on their 1 year experiences. This methods can bring students chances to experience their future majors, and a better choice can be followed after.\n Second, these days, many researchers conduct studies which are mixed area research. For example, a bio-engineer studies species by using big data and AI technologies. Traditional biologists may study with biological or chemical processes; in contrast, current ones do so with other area's technologies. Therefore, considering the current research trends, it is good for students to learn various fields, and for universities to give students various courses in order to make competent researchers.\n   In contrast to my side, many people still argue that there can be waste of time and resources during studying many courses. However, I still believe that large background knowledge is better than deep one. Taking many courses must be take times and energy, but this is not a waste, rather it is investment. Past experiences are the seed that will grow and give us achievement. In other words, sowing many seeds have more possibilities to make fruits. Thus, it is good to study various fields for future achievement. \n In conclusion, considering the factors above, it is easy to say that taking many courses has many benefits. Situation can be different person by person, but people in their age twenties are still young to take risks and challenge. In other words, spending times to look around various fields can not be a large risk in their life. Students still have to enjoy the chance to be bore ambitious.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 5.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 14.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively argues for the importance of taking many subjects, supporting its claims with relevant examples such as the freshman program at KAIST, but it lacks depth in discussing counterarguments, which could strengthen its overall content.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on a specific point, and a conclusion that summarizes the main ideas, which demonstrates strong organizational skills.\nJustification for Language: While the language is mostly clear, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'This methods can bring students chances' and 'taking many courses must be take times and energy,' which detract from the overall fluency and clarity of the writing."}]}

Moreover, there are big 4 industrial revolution as people live in earth. In name of revolution, each revolution involve, job and lifestyle are changed dramatically. And now, we are live in 4-th industrial revolution. AI are main issue in this revolution, which can evolve itself and learning speed is much more faster than people. Some people might says 'Many job will substitute employees to AI'. This means people might lost their jobs as soon. To win this emergency, people should study in universities and make creative think to lead society. Some people says university should make students to specialize in one subject. But as society becomes more complex, technology needs to make creative idea and inter-communicative thinking. For this reason, I would say universities should require students to take classes in many subjects.\n\n For the first reason, People can't win robot. Many scientist make game-playing robots from past. From the chess robot, now is Alphago's era. Many people says robot can't win go because there are so many kinds of behavior in one turn, and it is on;y human's sense. But all of people knows, Game result was 4:1. People absolutely lose. And even one win was belongs to Alphago's error, We can't say people is better than robot. And many people are surprised that this robot is learned this knowledge by machine-learning. This means, robot can learn types of knowledge by oneself. this means human can't challenge robot with their knowledge. They are already knows everything and they has super-massive speed. Then, how can we win? I think it is depend on creative and mix. There are not manual such as mix each type of knowledge, robot has no idea to mix idea or knowledge. so people's creative idea to mix knowledge is only one thing to win this robot. \n\n Second reason is level of class. In university, many professor says that undergraduate level class is basic. So, though you put your all time in just one subject, You are just knowing basic level of one subject. But if you learn many subject like math, computer science,...etc. Then you can think common point and different point at all subject. This can make your knowledge variety. If you go graduate school, you should research and make some many experiment. This variety knowledge will give you much more strong point.\n\n\n Third reason is your sight. At same event, people who learn many subject can think at variety sight. This people can analyze reason or effect at many sight and it can lead to most effective analyze. But other are different. People only one think just make one sight, and it would think that he or her think is only idea for this event. This is loss for other reason or effect. So Many idea can make your sight broader.\n\nTo complete this essay, this article show that  students to take classes in many subjects has many advantages for 3 reason. As society become complex, many think and creative idea is more important at this time. I agree that people should have broad idea and make society more better. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects the essay's lack of depth and clear argumentation, as evidenced by the vague assertion that 'AI are main issue in this revolution' without further elaboration on how AI specifically impacts education or job markets.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the essay's overall structure, which includes a clear introduction and separate paragraphs for each reason, but suffers from weak transitions and coherence, as seen in the abrupt shifts between ideas without effective linking phrases.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'this means human can't challenge robot with their knowledge,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

However, other universities' students except for those kinds of universities mentioned previously can take classes in only one subject. People think the second method efficient because of the depth of study. Although studying one subject has advantages which taking classes in more than one subject does not have, I think studying various kinds of subjects is better due to two reasons.\n    First of all, requiring students to take classes in many subjects makes the number of feeling like a failure of choice decrease. Even if people like the subject which they choose first, they can have another subject that people also want to learn. Therefore, if universities make students study more than one subject, people can study a subject which is the next choice, then, the percentage of disappointed thoughts with the first choice decreases. Although people want to change the main subject to another one, the rule of universities for the subject makes people feel less disappointed.\n    In addition to the student's feeling, the number of students who are similar to a person required in a company increase. For times progress, students have to study many subjects as lots of company need the usable person who can work in many cases of working. However, the range of study in one subject is limited, then, students cannot learn widely if a university ban studying more than one subject. Even if a university does not make a limitation of the choice for class, the subject makes students who are not the last order of getting a chance to take a class. Therefore, the rule of taking classes in many subjects can give more chance for students to study than the rule of taking classes in one subject.\n    To sum up, there are two rules for giving the power for students to choose the classes in the subject. The first method is requiring students to take classes in many subjects, and the next method is requiring students to take classes in one subject. Although both methods have advantages in each case, the first method can make students feeling better for their choice, and make students more needed in society. Therefore, I think universities which require students more various study is the better university.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay presents a clear argument in favor of taking various subjects, but it lacks depth in exploring the advantages, such as when the author states, 'Although studying one subject has advantages which taking classes in more than one subject does not have,' without elaborating on what those advantages are.\nJustification for Organization: The organization is generally effective, as the essay has a clear introduction and conclusion, but it suffers from some disjointed transitions, particularly in the second paragraph where the shift from discussing student feelings to job market needs feels abrupt and lacks a cohesive flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score reflects several grammatical and phrasing issues that detract from clarity, such as in the phrase, 'the number of feeling like a failure of choice decrease,' which is awkwardly constructed and confusing for the reader."}]}

While some universities do not require a choice of major before entrance. If students go to these universities, they choose their major after about 1 year or more year. They do not have a major, they have to take classes in many subjects. Some people said it is better to specialize in one subject. However, it is better to take classes in many subjects than to specialize in one subject because of the following three reasons.\n          First of all, it helps brains are developed to combine each subject; for example, there are many connections between chemistry and physics. Most reactions in chemistry can be described by physics. The student who learns physics and chemistry together can understand chemistry reaction easily compared with the student who learns only chemistry. Like this, there are many connections between each field even music and math. \n          Next, it helps to grow the ability that required complex thinking. During learning various subjects, there must be walls that interrupt one's thinking such as hard math questions. To solve this problem, people have to think in various ways and keep trying. A person who tries to think complex in various fields can improve his ability to solve problems. It can be used in not only study but also normal life.\n          However, some people said it is more helpful when someone works at his or her workplace to specialize in one subject, but it isn't. For instance, many people are required to produce a new phone such as product designer, engineer, and a person who is good at marketing. A phone that has high quality doesn't be sold when it has bad marketing. So, it requires co-work by various people from other fields. Understanding other fields are the most important point for the best work.\n          In conclusion, taking classes in many subjects is better than specializing in one subject. It will be more helpful for developing the brain to combine each subject. Second, the ability that required complex thinking must be developed. Moreover, it needs at the workplace. Many universities and companies want people who are good at corporations and many fields. It will be helpful to take in many subjects.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score is a 4.0 because the essay presents a clear argument for taking classes in many subjects, but it lacks depth in its examples, such as when it states, 'there are many connections between chemistry and physics' without providing further elaboration on these connections.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score is a 4.0 as the essay follows a logical structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, yet it could improve by using clearer topic sentences to better guide the reader through each point, particularly in the transition between the second and third paragraphs.\nJustification for Language: The language score is a 4.0 because the writing is generally clear and coherent, but there are grammatical errors such as 'the ability that required complex thinking' which should be 'the ability that is required for complex thinking,' indicating some issues with sentence structure."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.\u00a0\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nComputers Take Us Several Benefits\n\nDaily life had significant differences due to the appearance of computers. Among the various discussion topic, the debate topic \"Do computers make people's life more convenient or not?\" prompted people to take different views. Some people strongly believe that \"Computers have made life more complex and stressful.\". But I would like to make an argument against them that \"Computers have made life easier and more convenient.\"\n\nSome people are concerned about possibility which people's jobs substituted by computers. They argued that people will become more stressful because of decreasing occupational rate as computers appear. But I believe that computer does not take people's job away because computers' specialized jobs are different from people's. As computers developed, segregation with tasks that people make the better results and computers do appeared. Therefore, it makes our life more convenient.\n\nOther people pointed the problem that older generation cannot adjust to environment with computers. For example, most of grandfathers have a difficulty to use the internet for shopping. This can make older generation complex to daily life. However, there are so many education programs for older generation to teach about using the internet. And these programs help older generation adjust well to environment with computers.\n\nSomebody can argue that stressful and harmful effect caused by electromagnetic waves appeared as computers invented. Actually, exposure of electromagnetic waves for a long time deliver people stressful feeling and diseases. But electromagnetic waves which computers make were so small that people did not has an effect. And there are many panels which prevent from harmful waves. So convenience due to computers are more effective that stressful affect by them.\n\nIn earlier paragraphs, I delivered an argument that computers have made life more benefical and some refutations to counter-arguments from now on. Through the earlier paragraphs, readers can understand about convenience which computers make.

However, socially agreeable answer has not appear yet. Some people argues that computers have made life easier and more convenient; on the other hand, the other stated that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Between both sides, I agree with the opinion which argues computers are beneficial to human beings for following reasons: providing various contents, supporting complex calculations, and increasing accesibility of informations.\n       Firstly, computer provides various contents to people. It allows people to enjoy online games, stream movies, and chat with other people, regardless with time and place. Nowadays, a lot of people enjoys online games like League of Legends, and watch movie through streaming platform such as Netflix. They can enjoy these contents because of computer, which makes long-distance submission of videos and real-time interaction possible.\n      Secondly, computer supports complex calculations. computers can deal with complex calculations not only accuratively but also quickly. Therefore, it can solve equations that human cannot solve, such as equations for QR decomposition for large matrices. By solving those equations, computers extends the ranges of sciences which human can deal with. As a result, technologies that benefits human beings are invented much faster.\n      Finally, computers highly increases accesibility of various informations. Some people may state that there are plenty of worthless informations in the internet, and people can obtain high-quality informations at libraries, so computers have not contributed to increase accesibility of useful informations.

Although it provides significant advantages for people, some people argue that their lives became complex and stressful while others like the benefits from its convenience. There are two different aspects of computers, and I still think that computers have made life easier and more convenient for following reasons.\n\nFirst, people can save time by using computers because its speed of working is much faster than human. As a simple example, writing something on paper with a pencil is significantly slower than typing it with computers. As the purpose of the computers as a tool is to help people work more efficiently, it is true that using them can result convenience and time-saving. Moreover, computers are used in the area of making and moving robots which help people to do dangerous or repeated tasks such as cutting metals or coloring cars.\n\nNext, using computers takes an advantage that people can work on-line. If people do not use the tool, they should complete some stressful tasks by themselves such as sending a mail through a post office and wait for a person who they want to meet until he or she has time; however, if they use a computer, they can send an e-mail or contact the person on-line. Furthermore, in the period of COVID-19, the computer gives people an on-line lecture. Because of the disease, people have to stay home and can not visit their schools for lectures. Many people considered about a way to give students a lecture, and by using computer, they can teach their school members on-line with some tools such as ZOOM. \n\nHowever, there is a controversy that a computer is hard to learn, and the hardness make people stressful. It is true that learning a computer is difficult because people have to memorize the location of alphabets in keyboards, how to send an e-mail with some contents. But, once they learned about basics of the computer, not the complex parts of it such as coding, the benefits from using it come more significant than difficulties in learning it. And, learning basics like typing, web-surfing is not really hard comparing to their worry.\n\nTo summarize, because of a function as a tool, a computer benefits people's lives in aspects of time-saving and providing on-line circumstances. Although some people worry about a difficulty in learning the computer, I think that computers have made people's lives easier and more convenient because good things from using it comes bigger than the difficulty.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects the essay's solid argument for the benefits of computers, but it is weakened by a lack of depth in exploring the potential downsides, such as the statement that 'a computer is hard to learn' without providing sufficient evidence or examples to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay follows a logical structure with clear paragraphs, but it suffers from some awkward transitions, particularly between the second and third paragraphs where the shift to discussing the challenges of learning computers feels abrupt and underdeveloped.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate due to generally effective communication; however, it is marred by several grammatical errors, such as '21th century' instead of '21st century' and 'the hardness make people stressful' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Although some people claim that computer made life harder, since there are more things to learn and life become faster, I support that computer made life easier for three different reasons; e-mail internet, e-mail and programming.\nFirst, the invention of the internet is one of the greatest invention through human history which made human life easier. The internet helps our life in many different ways. One of the main function of the internet is searching.  Before the invention of internet, if you do not know the recipe of certain food, you have to find someone knows how to make the certain food and ask them. However using the internet, we can search unknown information through web-browser and there are millions of information collected from people in all over the world. \nThe second function of computer that helps our life is the e-mail. Before the invention of e-mail, in order to contact with friend who live far, we should either send a mail or go see the friend which take long time to contact. With the help of computer, we could communicate with others immediately using e-mail. These function further developed to the messenger such as kakao talk and zoom that people could communicate asynchronously.\nLastly, today there are many computer programs that helps our life. The computer process with the codes and if you are professional developer than you could make any program that you want. In most of industry, people make programs using computer to control machines. Learning programming is not an easy task, but it is important in development of many \nIn conclusion, computer made our life easier and more convenient in terms of information, communication and programs. The internet enable people to find millions of information made by various people. The e-mail and messengers enable people from far away to communicate asynchronously. The programming enable people to do anything they want. learning how to use the function of computer which could be complex and stressful however when you are familiar to use computer then your life will be easier and convenient.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's limited exploration of its main points, such as when the author mentions the benefits of e-mail but fails to provide adequate detail or examples of how it has transformed communication beyond just 'immediate' contact.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct paragraphs for each of the three reasons; however, transitions between ideas could be improved, as evidenced by the abrupt shift from discussing e-mail to programming without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is supported by the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in the sentence 'computer made life easier for three different reasons; e-mail internet, e-mail and programming,' which contains a redundancy and lacks clarity."}]}

Some people argue that computers changed our life more complex and stressful. I assert that computers developed our surroundings and made more convenient. There are three reasons; we can do work everything in house, we can buy things what we want easily, we can save our money more convenient and safe.\n\nFirst, we can do our work in house. Nowadays, every works in most jobs are done by using computer. For example, NAVER APP developer coding the code for developing app on computer, and architect designer draw things on computer. These works are done by computer and it can be done in house, because we just set computer in house and turn on it. It can save time and more convenient than go to company every morning. Moreover, working in house can save us from getting COVID-19.\n\nSecond, we can buy things that we need easily. In Choseon dynasty, people should go outside and buy food, cup, and many other things in off-line marker. In addition, people couldn't buy things from overseas. However, today, we can buy food and clothes on computer by just click the button in house. For example, people can buy food through LOTTE-online-shopping and buy clothes on MUSINSA. Thus, people don't have to go outside and buy things more convenient. Also, shopping in house can save people from getting COVID-19.\n\nNevertheless, some people think that using online banking is very complex and dangerous. However, I believe that using paper money is more complex and dangerous for managing. Because, paper money can be hurt, hard to save, and easy to lose it. However, by using online banking, money don't use real space and people just put credit card in her wallet.  Moreover, stealing money become more complex, because stealing paper become to hacking the system. Thus online banking by computer in more convenient than using paper money.\n\nComputers changed our daily life in shopping, working, and saving money. According to above, today's our life is more safe, more convenient and easier than past. We can do almost everything in our house by using computer even i write this essay. Doing something without stress of place is the best advantages in convenient. Therefore i assert that computers developed our surroundings and made more convenient.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects the essay's clear assertion that computers have made life more convenient, but it is weakened by the lack of depth in examples, as seen in the vague statement 'we can do work everything in house' which fails to provide specific details or varied perspectives.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, with each paragraph dedicated to a specific reason for the argument, though the transition between ideas could be improved, particularly in how the third point about online banking is introduced.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'more better' and 'money don't use real space,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some people may think that their life became more complex and stressful by the development of computers. However, I think that our lives have became easier and more convenient as the development of computers for the following three reasons.\n  First of all, the communication between people became easier as most people use computers or phones. Before the development of SNS, the quick conversations were impossible. When someone had to talk with other people, they had to use telephone call or go for face-to-face talking. However, most of all people communicate with SNS, while very few communications are performed by face-to-face conversation in theses days. These SNS system could be developed as the rise of the use of computer and internet web. Also, the relationship between people has developed and conversation has increased because talking or chatting is easy and convenient on SNS.\n  Not only the convenient conversation but also the convenient use of money is a important positive effect of computers. These days, people don't need to bring bills or coins to buy products. They only need small cards or their phones. Calculating money with bills and coins might be complicated and cause problems such as the cost of long time for finding coins. These days, by the kiosk, consumers can pay money easily without talking with workers. Additionally, consumers can buy products at home for internet market. They can compare products easily and get them by package system without bringing heavy bags from the market. Only some clicks at home allows them to buy easily. As they reduce time for buying or paying money, they can use the time for other purposes. In other words, the process of paying money became faster and efficient.\n  Finally, the development of computers helped other developments of technologies. Computers can perform calculations or simulations in very high speed than humans; as a result, people can research or enhancing previous technologies faster in research labs or factories. The more computers are used, the more developments can be occur. Most of the technologies which make people's lives convenient such as wireless machines, public transportation system, smart phones with higher qualities are based on computer system. Moreover, experts say that extreme level of development was shown in recent 100 years as the development of computers.\n  To sum up, I think the development of computers had a great role for making our lives easier and more convenient because the computers have allowed convenient conversation using SNS, efficient money-paying system and great development of all technologies. People should use the technologies in right way receiving all good points of the them including computers.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a solid argument for the benefits of computers, but it lacks depth in some areas, such as the statement 'the relationship between people has developed' which is vague and does not provide specific examples or evidence to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay follows a clear structure with a logical progression of ideas, particularly seen in the transition from discussing communication to the convenience of financial transactions, but it could be improved with more explicit topic sentences for each paragraph.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay demonstrates good control of grammar and vocabulary, though errors like 'became' instead of 'become' in 'our lives have became easier' detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. However, I think that computers have made life easier and more convenient for three reasons.\n\nFirst, computers help us to get information easier. It is normal that everyone has curiosity when we study something new. Some people prefer to resolve their curiosity by finding books or dictionaries. In contrast, using computers can find the information we want faster than before. In addition, there are some web browsers which automatically programmed based on big data. Using that web browser, we can get further information or complement information. For that reason, we can get advantages of getting information when we study.\n\nSecond, computers can help us as a tool to compute our complicated and repeated tasks. Imagine that there is a complicated experiment project which requires many calculations. In that case, calculating in hand can make a mistake and can affect the result of the whole expriment. On the other hand, using computers in that case, there are no possibilities to make any mistake and the speed of the process will be more efficient. In that aspect, using a computer can also give us advantages.\n\nLast but not least, computers can help us enjoy and relax. Some people argue that playing computer games or watching media(drama, movie, etc) can be dangerous because that can result in them to pain-mode on computers. Nevertheless, if we have some time to manage computer using time, the possibility to get in pain-mode will be very low. And the more, we can get relaxation with computers.\n\nTo sum up, some people disagree with using computers since they are worried about the complexity of computer systems and the dangers of spending much time using computers. However, if users manage their using times efficiently, they will get more advantages of getting information, use them as a complex calculator, and a way to relax and enjoy.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects the essay's clear argument that computers provide significant advantages, such as faster access to information, but it could be improved by providing more specific examples or statistics to support these claims, as seen in the vague reference to 'some web browsers which automatically programmed based on big data.'\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with each paragraph dedicated to a distinct advantage of computers, although the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly in the second paragraph where the shift from calculating to the benefits of efficiency feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in the phrase 'result in them to pain-mode on computers,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some people may assert that computers deprive leisure time and increase our stress by making people are too dependent on computer. However, I strongly belive that computers achieve conveninent life on now for the following reasons. \n\nFIrstly, computers be able to perform several complex tasks instead of people. Before the invention of computer, people should calculate all calculus equation by their hands, and it spends long period to complete even with mistaskes. Some people might argue that people become too dependent on compure, because it can handle the things to do so easily. However, people can gain  more leisure time by reduce their meaninglessly wasting works and feel satisfaction from enjoying another hobbies.\n\nSecondly, computers are particularly capable to deal with on-tact works. Nowadays, although strict limitations ban people's ordinary behaviors on life, computers get rid of the virtual Covid19-wall among people. It is true that, if there was no computer, people would meet each other and spend more time. Nevertheless, computer performs the role of essential key on now and people maximize their happiness that stealed from Covid19.\n\nIn conclusion, computers have made our life more easier and conveninet by saving human's time. Furthermore, computers are clearly essential to retain nowadays' ordinary life against Covid19. After computer was invented, human obtained freedom from samely reciprocal works and it allowed people to use their time more colorful.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.\u00a0\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nThe discussion of whether computers have made life easier or more complex and stressful has always been an argumentative one for the modern times. Even though many people claim the fact that computers are one of the significant elements that cause stress and complexity due to the fact that they had extremely increased the responsibilities and competition, this essay asserts the validity of the argument that computers have made life better and more convenient as a consequence of the following justifications.\n\n    To begin with, it would be natural to observe that computers have enabled people to do many things when compared to the past. The evidence suggests that the growth of possibilities is exponential. To illustrate, modern people are able to access information and data instantly by means of the computer networking called internet. Moreover, by means of this beneficial invention, anyone having an internet connection can communicate to a person who is thousands of kilometers far away. Even more, by means of the power of computation, people do not have to perform error prone, tiring and boring calculations which might be very crucial for a scientific project. When those huge benefits are analyzed, it can be seen that the freedom of contemporary people had been increased remarkably when compared to past. Thus, claiming that computers have not give humanity a chance to make their lives easier, would not be reasonable.\n   \n    Another important aspect that computers have a great role is that contemporary people live longer and healthier. According to the recent data, the expected lifespan of humans have increased by five to ten years in the countries that advanced in technology. Since it would be possible to directly related computerization with technology, this data would be a direct indicator of one of the huge benefits of computers. To analyze the contributions of computerization to the health industry; examples of computer modellings of human body, more accurate treatment devices and robotic supports in operations, can be given. Therefore, the role of computers in health industry is inevitably important.\n\n    Besides the facts that computers have such great advantages, many people claim that computer have made life very complicated and stressful. The underlying reason behind this claim is that the capability of computers to perform various tasks without significant human effort. When this is the case, the level of the jobs that humans are expected to do have been increased dramatically because the evolution of computer industry is extremely rapid. In that case, it might be the case that people have adaptation problem to this situation. However, people should not think in a self-oriented way in that situation. Since the evolution of ideas and life had always been the reality, the same complexity and stressfulness will not be a big burden for the next generation as they will easily adapt to this situation. For the current generation that may have those issues with computerization, they should get educations on how to efficiently utilize this device and technology. Thus, those issues can be seen as non-permanent and fixable issues.\n\n    To conclude, it would be possible to indicate the fact that computers are very beneficial for humanity in terms of making life easier and more convenient when compared to the past. Even though there might be some issues regarding the computerization, it would be possible to show that humanity will adapt the computerized society soon in case they intend to obtain the proper education. Thus, in order to improve the standards of our lives, investments in computer industry would be a beneficial and highly profitable one.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 5.0/5\nOverall Score: 14.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: While the essay presents a clear argument that computers have made life easier, it lacks depth in exploring counterarguments, as seen in the brief acknowledgment of the complexity and stress caused by computers without providing substantial evidence or examples to support this point.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is well-structured with clear topic sentences and logical flow; however, the transition between discussing the benefits of computers and addressing the counterargument could be smoother, as the shift feels somewhat abrupt in the third paragraph.\nJustification for Language: The language used in the essay is articulate and varied, exemplified by phrases like 'freedom of contemporary people had been increased remarkably,' but it contains grammatical errors such as 'computers have not give humanity,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some people think that using computers facilitated many processes in their life, making it more comfortable and easy.Whereas, others claim that computers have made life more complicated than before. I strongly believe that new technology such as computers have more positive effects on our daily life.\n        Firstly, it is worth to mention that every field  started to develop faster after invention of computers.Because, computers treated as a source of power, that effectively changes people. Also, even though computers have been created  by human being, they have good memory and functions, which helps to easily analysis big datas comparing to  people.For example, in quantum chemistry scientists use quantum computers that computes complex functions and gives appropriate results, whereas people an able to compute that kind of functions.\n       Secondly, our daily life become much more convenient as everything started to digitalised.It is the consequence of using computers. Because, computers are capable of doing many functions in a short period of time in compare to people.Therefore, it is much more convenient to use computers instead of people.In addition to this, computers do not ask money.In other words, computers are best option for economic development.\n       On the other hand, we should consider that using computers can lead to some diseases, and make people's life more stressful.For example, sitting in front of computer for a long time can lead to heart disease. However, it is the case, when people use computers for too a long time. Using computers for short time period do not affect people's health.\n      In conclusion, even though using computers can have some bad effects on our life such as making life complex and stressful, the contribution of computers to the fast development of the world is much more worthy.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay presents a clear argument in favor of computers, supported by examples such as the use of quantum computers in quantum chemistry; however, it lacks depth in discussing the negative aspects, which weakens the overall content quality.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is organized into clear sections with a logical flow, but the transition phrases, such as 'On the other hand,' could be more effectively used to enhance coherence between contrasting points.\nJustification for Language: The language used in the essay is generally understandable, but there are grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'computers treated as a source of power,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

For example computer can classify all products on the internet, which is hard and boring work for people. Thanks to computers that do boring and time consuming things instead of people, people can concentrate on more important things and enjoy their time. \n  These days, computers are used in everywhere in our life.  Computers  can do what people can't do, what people don't want to do. It is hard to imagine life without computers.  If computers are disappear suddenly, the life will be more complex and stressful.

Others say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. Which do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.\u00a0\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nLet's think about the things that we enjoy. Movies, cartoons, illusts, Youtube videos...etc. If these things will be disappear at the moment, can we enjoy the life? How about the documents, reports, papers? Is it okay? Because of this, I agree with the opinion that computers have made life easier and more convenient. There are 3 reasons that why.\n\nFirst of all, by using the computer; we can find and share informations very easily. To be more specific, thanks to the word processor, we can type letters on the document file in the computer. This is important, because of the lasting time. When we save the document file in the memory of the compueter, without any physical force; we can find and share the informations any time, and to anybody. Several experts said that the 21st century is the period of information. We can earn the informations by each other and able to develop the society together. This is one of the reason that why computer make life convenient.\n\nSecond, computer is a good tool. According to the result of Jean Pierre, who is the professor of the Harvard University, he said that human can memorize 10% of the conversation without any writing. For example, if we take the one-hour lecture without any writing, we can only memorize for 6 minutes. By contrast, according to the Jean Pierre again, if we take notes for the conversation, human can memorize 80%. Let's focus on this result. To memorize the informations of the conversation, we need to take notes. However, human's hand isn't fast as much as needed. To take the notes, human neeed to find tool. That is the computer, which make life easier. \n\nFinally, computer is faster and efficient than human. Because of the high-concentrated information circuit(hereafter abbreviated as IC), computer can compute every calculation, even if it is difficult. In case of the differential equation, human can solve linear form only. In case of the non-linear differential equation, human cannot find the answer because we need approximate the equation. Due to its enormous size of the calculation, human's brain can't solve it. On the other hand, IC, which have about millions of brain on the chipset, can calculate it in few minutes. Efficiency of calculation of the computer bring us the convenience.\n\nTo sum up, computer is the good tool to us. Without computer, we can't develop the society. This is the reason that why I agree to the opinion: computers have made life easier and more convenient.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's attempt to argue that computers have made life easier, but it lacks depth and clarity, particularly in the second reason where the argument about note-taking is not clearly connected to the overall thesis, as seen in the awkward phrasing, 'human can memorize 10% of the conversation without any writing.'\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay with an introduction, three supporting points, and a conclusion, though the transition between the ideas could be smoother, particularly when introducing the second reason, which feels somewhat disjointed.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 indicates that while the essay communicates its points, it suffers from grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'computer make life easier' instead of 'computers make life easier,' which detracts from its overall clarity and professionalism."}]}

However, some elders face difficulties in using computers. Although some people claim that computer made life stressful, I believe that computer has improved life for the following reasons.\n First, people can do their work faster with their computers. There are a variety of tools that help people's work. For example, Microsoft Office assists people to write their files with Word and make sources for their presentation with PowerPoint. Without them, people have to make their sources with hand, and it needs more time than using computer. In addition, people can do their group work well with some applications; Kakaotalk or Google docs. With applications based on Internet, they no longer have to move to meet their team, so they can save much time. \n Secondly, people invented lots of other tools that made people's life more convenient. For instance, with computer, people invented smart phones, subway management system, and etc. Nowadays, people don't have to work a lot with those inventions. Moreover, computer can do a machine learning; constructing an AI and learning with big data. With those AI, people's quality of life will be improved a lot because they can drive a car, cook some food, and solve some simple problems. People can study or enjoy their hobbies during the AI is helping their daily works.\n It can be argued that computers have made life more complex because there are too many things to study to use computers. On the contrary, the saved time by using computer is much more than time which was spent by learning the way to use that; besides, the using computer has become easier, too. Computer programmers are trying to make simple and effective user-interfaces like one-touch systems. Furthermore, there are some computer programs for old people or children. \n In conclusion, computer made people's life more easier because it made people work faster, there are many inventions with it, and controlling computer is becoming easier. Since the development of computer is rapidly, people won't have to do simple and tired work in the future.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's solid arguments, such as the mention of applications like Kakaotalk and Google Docs that facilitate group work, but it lacks depth in exploring the implications of these advancements on various demographics, particularly the elderly.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, including an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but the transitions between ideas could be smoother, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing tools to the benefits of AI without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 highlights issues with grammar and word choice, such as the incorrect phrase 'computer has improved life' instead of 'computers have improved life,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Although some people think the computers have made our life more complex and stressful, I claim that computers have made life easier and more convenient.\n\nThanks to computers, we can use various data more easily. Computers has the large space to storage information, and it doesn't take to much space compare to the information in paper. if the computer had not been developed, people might have to work with the large amount of papers on the desk. Also, because the computer has better computation ability than people, we can assemble data fast and correctly to make the result that we want. \n\nEven in the case that computers are not used for the data work, computer made our lives more convenient. One example is the bank work. Through the past, until the computer has developed, people had to go to the bank themselves to save money, or send money, and etc. Because banks are the places that only run before the 6 p.m., going to the bank had made the schedule more complex. However, people can use the bank services by their own computer now. Therefore, people can modify their schedule more flexible.\n\nThese days, computer has been one of the must-have item and almost everyone has a personal computer now.  Although some people would feel stress due to the complex stages of the work made by the computers, it is obvious that computer has helped us working with data, and using time more efficiently.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 is justified by the essay's lack of depth in its arguments, particularly in the statement 'Although some people think the computers have made our life more complex and stressful,' which is not adequately explored or countered with substantial evidence.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, as it effectively separates the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion, but it could be improved with smoother transitions between ideas, such as the abrupt jump from discussing data handling to banking services.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted as the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and grammar, although there are errors such as 'Computers has the large space' and 'it doesn't take to much space compare to the information in paper' that detract from the overall clarity."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.\u00a0\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nSince computers were invented, there have been arguments about whether computers make life easier and more convenient, and even now, they make controversy. There are two main perspectives. One is that computers make life easier and more convenient, and the other is that computers have made life more complex and stressful because they made people work outside the workspaces and cause various of diseases especially for eyes. Though, second perspective is lso persuasive, I think computers have made easier and more convinient because they offer a lot of softwares that can entertain people, improve the productivity of people, and connect people to people.\n First, computers have improved our productivity in workspaces. Before the computers have invented, when people want to get statistical informations, they needed to calculate and compare all the values they got from their investigation. In contrast, after the invention of the computers and development of spreadsheet office program, all the statistical analysis have been able to do with just some mouse clicks and draggings. Therefore, people have advanced the ability to use bigger size of datasets which are more meaningful than small datasets an improved work efficiency. \n Second, computers have connected people more closely. After the invention of computers and distrbution of internet services, various types of online communications have been created. These new communication tools have different characteristics to other communication methods like phone call and SMS(small size message of mobile phone), for example, Facebook, one of the most popular SNS nowadays, have a simple-blog like form of communication. When people want to share somthing, then people write and upload a short post with pictures. And then other people who have access permission to that post can read it and write comments. That's how people communicate through Facebook and it is unpresented way of communication before. Through various form of communication that computer offer, people have been able to share more about themselves to other people, people have got closed each other.\n In other perspective, computers make people stressful by let people work outside the workspace. However, the stress from work is not from the computers, it's from the work. Before the invention of the computers, people didn't work outside workspaces, however, they worked for more than 20 hours, in 19C. Because of the improved productivity by computer, people can go back to their home, not always work in workspaces, so working outside workspaces cannot be the bad effect of computers, reversely, it's an evidence of more comfortable life than past by computer.\n The computers offer people productivity-improving tools and connect people. Although the computers also make people work outside the workspaces more frequently, the inconvinience and time-wasting caused when the computers are not present are much bigger than that bad effect. In conclusion, the computers have made life more convinient and easier than before through improving productivity and connecting people more closely.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's clear argument that computers improve productivity and connectivity, yet it is somewhat weakened by the lack of depth in the counterargument, particularly in the statement that 'the stress from work is not from the computers, it's from the work,' which oversimplifies the issue.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified as the essay follows a logical structure with clear topic sentences for each paragraph; however, the transition between the discussion of productivity and connectivity could be smoother to enhance coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate due to the essay's generally effective communication, though errors such as 'convinient' and 'distrbution' reveal a need for more careful proofreading to avoid distracting the reader."}]}

Some people may assert that computers have made life more complex and streesful; however, I strongly believe that computers have improved the life more easier.\nTo begin with, computers help people by connecting all people to ubiquitous network. I think that computer is the first device for ubiquitous network, and it means that people not only can get various information such as a weather forecast immediately but also break the boundary between people in different places and time. People are connected with each other by the computer network; therefore, there is huge convenience for people who live in the modern society and the revolution of information because they can work together whenever they are, and wherever they are. For instance, people can do their work or study in the colleges because of the development of computers and ubiquitous network system, even in the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that the value of information from computers is much higher than the stress caused by computers.\nOn top of that, people can alter their labor by computers and increase their work efficiency. Of course, some people can claim that computers will alter all humans because people do not have advantages in the workplace, and this is why people feel streesful on computers; nonetheless, I believe that people have to give their simple work to computers. It is well-known that computers are not good at some regions such as analyzing images, creating a new idea or emotional work. Not only these regions but also many parts of human work need people's creative brains, not just mathematical calculations. If people use computers only in hard work that cannot be done by people or takes too long time to finish, computers can help people and people can live more easier with their own jobs. This occurs in various parts such as the design, the research, and even the work at the factory now and almost people in that workplaces tend to recognize the need of computers.\nTo sum up, computers can provide ubiquitous network so people can work together whenever and wherever they are, and people can give some of their simple work to computers to increase the work efficiency. In this regard, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient. I think that there is no reason not to use computers if there are advantages from computers in appropriate parts.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively argues that computers have made life easier by providing ubiquitous connectivity and improving work efficiency, as seen in the discussion about how people could continue their studies during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, it lacks depth in addressing potential counterarguments more thoroughly, which could enhance the overall argument.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is well-organized with clear introductory and concluding paragraphs, as well as logically structured body paragraphs; however, the transition between ideas could be improved to enhance the flow, particularly between the first and second points regarding connectivity and labor efficiency.\nJustification for Language: While the language used is generally clear and appropriate for the topic, there are noticeable grammatical errors such as 'made life more easier' and 'streesful,' which detract from the overall professionalism and clarity of the essay."}]}

And in relation to the computer's effect, there has long been a discussion. Some people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. However, I think computers have made life easier and more convenient for the following reasons.\nFirst, computers can improve the efficiency of work. It can do works that human requires a long time, like calculations or word typing, in a very short time. For example, a few weeks ago, I forgot to bring my computer when I went to a library to study. Because I only had a note and a pencil, I wrote a note by hand. It took a very long time to write all of them compared to when I take a note on a computer. So there is no doubt that the computer saves time.\nNext, we can easily enjoy our free time with computers. Without a complex procedure, we can enjoy many exciting things like games, television programs, and even a concert. For example, when you want to see a concert at a concert hall, it needs many time and money. However, if you use computers, you only have to turn on the computer and enjoy it in your room freely. With computers, we can not only enjoy various activities but also save money,\nFinally, with computers, we don't have to move long distances. We can easily work or listen to a lecture at home. Also, there are many shopping applications, so we can easily buy items at home. Computers reduced our efforts to move a long distance to do activities.\nFor these reasons, I think that computers make our life better.

Despite the opinion that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I still believe that the computers have made modern life more convenient for the following reasons.  \n The first reason that computers have helped life to be more convenient is computers reduced repetitive works in modern life. The representative example is calculations. In the field of bio-science, computers are used to find specific DNAs that cause serious diseases or disorders in the whole enormous genome data. Also, in the field of economy, since computers automatically calculating taxes based on each citizens' income, government could make fairer tax systems than before. Like these examples, computers' repetitive works enabled people discover new facts and even gave time to concern about more innovative thoughts.\n Some people might argue that the development of computers brought complex questions as well as new facts like the unknown reasons why computational facts and real life fact is different.

So there is no doubt that the computer saves time.\nNext, we can easily enjoy our free time with computers. Without a complex procedure, we can enjoy many exciting things like games, television programs, and even a concert. For example, when you want to see a concert at a concert hall, it needs many time and money. However, if you use computers, you only have to turn on the computer and enjoy it in your room freely. With computers, we can not only enjoy various activities but also save money,\nFinally, with computers, we don't have to move long distances. We can easily work or listen to a lecture at home. Also, there are many shopping applications, so we can easily buy items at home. Computers reduced our efforts to move a long distance to do activities.\nFor these reasons, I think that computers make our life better. And I believe computers' improvement will cause human's more convenient life.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay provides clear reasons supporting the argument that computers make life easier, such as improving work efficiency through quick calculations, but it lacks depth in exploring the complexities of the argument, particularly in addressing counterarguments more thoroughly.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate because the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, yet the transitions between ideas could be smoother to enhance the overall flow of the argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted as the essay demonstrates a good command of English with varied vocabulary and clear expression, but it contains grammatical errors, such as 'the computer's effect' and 'computer's improvement,' which detract from the overall clarity of the writing."}]}

Over the last few years, there have been and arguments about whether or not computers provide several advantages to human society. Numerous people argue that it results in better and more convenient life. On the other hand, others concern about new problems that can be emerged because of this technology . Indeed, I believe that computer can bring more complexity to everyone's life.\n\nOne major argument is that people can communicate with one another easily due to computer. There are various websites and applications that allow people to send messages via their platforms, such as facebook, and email; therefore, people can communicate with one another although they are staying in different place. On account of this features, it provides the advantages for both of working with colleagues living in other countries and contacting foreign investors to expand business.\n\nHowever, the opponents of the idea which supports the advantages of computers state that the emergence of computer also lead some problem which must be taken into account. For example, in case of health problem, if individuals use computers for a long period, their eyes might be hurt. In addition, sitting on a chair with unsuitable position can cause a person to have a back pain.\n\nAnother issue relates to ethnical problems. It cannot be denied that the introduction of computer associates with the development of cyber space which can be seen as another world of human society. In this world, it allows people to express their identitiy while their real ones are unknown. Hence, it allow people to behave inappropriately without concerning about the impact to their real life. For example, many individauls can post the hate speech related to a person they do not satisfy.\n\nIn conclusion, although the computers can make people life easier, it comes up with new serious problem. Since the development of this technology continues, it is impoartant to find the appropriate way to manipulate new emerged problems.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5/5 is justified because the essay presents a clear argument regarding the pros and cons of computers, particularly noting how they facilitate communication, yet it lacks depth in exploring the complexities of the issues raised, such as the vague mention of 'health problems' without specific examples or statistics.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5/5 is warranted as the essay follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs discussing both sides of the argument, and a conclusion, although the transition between points could be improved, especially when shifting from health issues to ethical concerns.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5/5 is appropriate since the essay uses mostly clear and coherent language, yet it contains several grammatical errors, such as 'the emergence of computer also lead some problem,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some people say that the upcoming technology of computers have made life easier and more convenient, but others do not agree. They say that computers have made their life more complex and stressful. While those people think like that, I still strongly believe that computers provide comfort and easy life by several supporting reasons: ease in communication, and information accessibility.\n\nWith computers, people could solve one of important problems in the past that is communication problem. If we look through the past, it took pretty long time to communicate with someone far away. At that time, people may use birds or horses as the fastest way to send letters. The presence of computer make the ease in communication through the internet that link every part of the world with social network. With this technologies, we could contact with the person who we are missing or want to talk with using just several seconds. Phone is considered to be a small computer which is a good example of how it make more convenient on the communication such as video call, email, chat application.\n\nFor the second reasons, we can obviously see that computers provide the convenient in the accessibility of the information. While people in the past had to go to the library to search for the interested information or look at the newspaper, people in the world of technology do not have to do that. With computers, they can use search engines to find whatever they want to know; for example, the recipes of dinner, various categories of news, weather forecasting, and also GPS. People do not need to waste their time for looking at many books to get one knowledge as plenty amounts of data are now in the internet, which could be looking by computers.\n\nTo summary, ease in communication and information accessibility are just two out of plenty reasons to support how computers have made life easier. Although some people would argue this statement with some computers' disadvantages, I am still sure that computers have changed the world to be a better place.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's adequate support for the thesis, but it lacks depth, particularly in the second reason where the author could have provided more specific examples of how computers improve information accessibility beyond just mentioning search engines.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay is structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on a specific point, and a conclusion, although the transition between ideas could be smoother to enhance flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is supported by the author's generally clear expressions, but there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as \"the upcoming technology of computers have made life easier,\" where 'have' should be 'has,' indicating a need for more careful proofreading."}]}

Numerous people's daily lives would probably consist of using options such as email, online texting, handling documents, watching movies, etc. However, the issue about whether computers influenced life in a positive way or in a negative way remains controversial. Regardless of benefits that computers offer, sometimes, people are overwhelmed or addicted to the programs they use and feel uncomfortable. Although some people argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I insist that computers have made life easier and more convenient.\n First of all, there exists an argument that people get confused and feel complexity because of severely numerous options that computer offers. Especially when it comes to the old, people can easily observe old people not knowing how to handle electronic devices including computers. However, this kind of difficulty occurs because computers deal with numerous tasks in a short time. By understanding basic manuals to use computers, people will be able to complete a number of tasks with less effort and their life will be much more efficient and convenient. \n Second, some argue that people's lives became stressful because they can easily be addicted to the entertaining programs. It is true that people now have numerous games, movies to be addicted when they use computers. Also these kind of entertainments are usually not easy to overcome. However, there are also useful options that prevents addiction. If we use anti-addiction programs that limits the usage of time, etc, we can effectively shut it down. Therefore, computers provide good options.\nIn conclusion, computers have made life easier and more convenient for two reasons. Although using options of computer might be difficult and people can be easily addicted to them, computers could provide us with so many useful options including solutions for each problem. As technology advances, the function of the computer will also be improved. It would be interesting to observe it.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's clear stance on the positive impact of computers, but it lacks sufficient depth in addressing the counterarguments, as seen in the brief mention of addiction without exploring its implications fully.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the logical progression of ideas, yet the transitions between points could be smoother, as evidenced by the abrupt shift from discussing complexity to addiction without clear linkage.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted due to generally clear expression, although it contains several grammatical errors such as 'the programs they use and feel uncomfortable,' which detracts from the overall fluency and clarity."}]}

It is undeniable that most of our activities are done with computer, just like attending a lecture, doing assignments, contact with other people, and so on. Looking at this dependence on computers of our life, someone claims that the computers have made life easier and more convenient, but I believe that computers have made our life more complex and stressful with following reasons.\n    First, working on computers has many negative effects on health. People have to focus on monitor screen, which is close to their eyes, for a long time. Consequently, it gives a massive stress to their eyes and neck. This finally results in bad eyes and turtle neck syndrome. Computers must have the responsibility on the increasing of the number of people who wear glasses. \nneck. Moreover, people tends to sit long time in their chair due to computer jobs, so it causes less physical activity, which is not good for overall health.\n    Second, people have to learn more and more tools and programming languages. As computer technology is being advanced, It becomes even harder to 'use computer well'. In fact, the meaning of the person who is good at computer has been changed. In past, It was enough to use computer programs well, such as excel, word and powerpoints. Nowadays, the ability of coding is required to make their own programs. People have to learn programming languages like java, python, and c++ to do an advanced work on the computers.\n     On the other hands, someone may say, it is true that computers made our life convenient. However, I think that computer is just doing simple jobs, so what are remaining for us are complex jobs.

Although some people might say that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I strongly believe that our life has become more convenient thanks to computer.\n   First of all, computers can do so many things that humans can not even try. For example, computers are able to calculate about 10^12 times faster than human. Therefore, there are no need for people to spend countless times on our daily occurring calculations. Also, computers enabled us to storage thousands of documents, videos, recordings, and so on. Before computer was invented, only thing people could do to save their works was writing down on a piece of paper. But now, thanks to the enormous amount of computer's storage, people are able to maintain their results.\n   Secondly, computers are the key factor of using internet. Nowadays, it is almost impossible to live without an internet. People use internet everywhere at anytime; order products from website, email each other, or use internet banking. Because of the development of computers, people could easily access to internet, which made our life much more convenient and easier.\n   In conclusion, thanks to the computer's ability and access to internet, people's life become way better and easier than before. There could be some complexion or stress due to using computer  , but the benefits are beyond its negative effects.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a lack of depth in the arguments presented, as seen in the claim that computers calculate faster than humans without providing specific real-world implications or examples of how this speed improves daily life.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is warranted as the essay presents a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but it could enhance clarity by improving transitions between ideas, particularly between the first and second points about computers.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is supported by generally effective communication, yet it contains grammatical errors such as 'there are no need' instead of 'there is no need' and awkward phrasing like 'the only thing people could do to save their works,' which detracts from overall clarity."}]}

Some people even claim that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I still assert that they made our life easier and more convenient.\n\nFirst of all, almost every piece of equipment that we use nowadays are including computers. Especially, that we cannot live without them. For example, a smartphone is a small computer that we always bring along. It will be a great pain to live without a smartphone for a day. We cannot know where to go, what to eat, and what to do. Not only a smartphone but also the home appliance such as dishwasher, and washing machine include computers. It is obvious that they are making our life much more simple.\n\nIn addition to the idea that we are already using lots of computers, it is clear that computers are essential for next-generation technology which will make our life more convenient. Many computer scientists around the world are working on a new computer that leads to the technological revolution. In particular, AI is a computer-based technology. AI can replace humans at hard work, and reduce risks or hardness of human's life. \n\nNevertheless that we are already using lots of computers and much more in the future, some people still claim that computers make more hardness in our life. They assert that SNS, which is based on the computer makes complexity between human relationships. However, there is much more advantage. We can easily get daily news from SNS and communicate with other people without contact.\n\nIn conclusion, I claim that computers have made human life much easier and more convenient. For reason, we are already using lots of computers in our daily life and we cannot live without them.

There have been massive and fierce controversies about whether computers are helpful for our lives or not. Certainly, various opinions may exist. One side argues that computers have made life more complex and stressful. This is contradicted by the claim that disadvantages of computers much less than the advantages of those. In addition, when the development cause easily and the society more complex, people should adapt and changed their movements and reactons. If they should not change their situation, they will dissapear in the progressive world. However, in my opinion, there is no little doubt that computers have made life easier and more convenient for the following reasons.\n To begin with, computers led a development of technolgy. This is because computer can make people deliver the infromation for other people much more easily. It is evedient that it is comfortable to get and give informations compared with the the past without computers. In the past, if people want to search data, they ask and direct experience. Nowdays, it is easy to get search and read paper in the internet. In addition, the developments of technology make our lives more easily and improve the various academic terms like science, math and art. \n On the top of that, computers give a chance for education. In fact, Africa and asia childern are hard and dangerous to go school, and  they can not achive to study. However, the social company like world vision, and Unichef give them to study. The imbalance of education is not problems for developing country. It can also occur in Korea. In the spring, COVID-19 virus happen and many peole restrict to movements. Furthurmore, the children must stay in home and study using online school classes. \n Finally, Youtube and Google have tremendous media and vedio to give indrect experience. For instance, People who want to go outside and go abroad experience activity in home. If people want to get informations, they just search on goole and learn how to do. Moreover if you want to watch past drama, it is easy to wach you tube.\n To sum up, Some people claim that compuer makes our more complex. It is evident that society more complex beccause of increasing entropy in the view of nature science. The developments of tecchonogy, broad chance to education and indirect experiences is possible due to computers. In this regard, I belive that the computers have made life easier and more convienient.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's ability to present a clear argument in favor of computers, but it lacks depth and supporting evidence, such as when it states, 'the developments of technology make our lives more easily' without elaborating on specific examples or data to substantiate this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion; however, the transitions between ideas could be improved, such as the abrupt shift from discussing education to the role of YouTube without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate given the overall clarity of expression, but the presence of numerous spelling and grammatical errors, such as 'infromation,' 'achive,' and 'vedio,' detracts from the overall quality of the writing."}]}

The tool which is central in the society of information is a computer. The issue of whether computers have made life easier and more convenient or computers have made life more complex and stressful has always been a hot potato in modern society. Although some people think that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I argue that computers have made life easier and more convenient for the following reasons.\n\nFirst, by using computers, we can access information we need much more easier than before computers were developed. Also, we can easily calculate very complicated calculation by computer and do more meaningful things at remaining time.\n\nSecond, we can make full use of working at home and online lecture by computer particularly circumstance like now, pervasion of COVID-19. If we do not have any communicational devices like computer, our life could differ extremely to life before the outbreak of COVID-19, more than now.\n\nHowever, some argue that computers have made more complex and stressful by these reasons. They insist that using computer change lifestyle more indoor and make posture bad for neck and waist. And advantage of computer that people can achieve things without moving cause people not to move at all. As a result, there can be a problem caused by shortage of workout. Of course, these problems can be cause by using computers; However, we can overcome them by making advantage of remaining time earned by computers. People can surely improve their work efficiency by using computer and using that time by workout then it would be more better than not using computer. Even though some problem can be occurred by using computers, advantage earned by using computer is more huge.

For example, people in Korea could know the result of the American president's vote result immediately through computer news. Moreover, the computer can calculate tons of information during the science and mathematical experiment. for instance, most KAIST students experience experiments that analyze information by using the computer.

Finally, computers could gather people who have different backgrounds and cultures. therefore, people are able to cooperate easily by using a computer. However, there is a risk of using a computer. despite fast information, false information exists too. and some people claim that they have to treat more information which causes people to be stressed and work because of the computer. \n To sum up, the computer has both pros and cons. but I think that the advantage of the computer is larger than the disadvantage of the computer.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's strength in presenting the benefits of computers, such as providing fast information, but it lacks depth in discussing the negative aspects, as shown by the shallow treatment of false information and stress caused by excessive information.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay is structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs discussing various points, and a conclusion, although the transition between ideas could be smoother, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing benefits to the risks of computers.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 indicates some proficiency, but it suffers from grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'despite fast information, false information exists too', which detracts from the overall clarity and fluency of the writing."}]}

Some people claim that computer have made computers have made life more complex because modern people should understand how computers work. However, in my opinion, computers have made life more convenient for 3 reasons below. \n   First, computers replace human labor. In the past, people calculated all things such as costs and data by their hands. On the contrary, people do not have to treat simple work, so computers have made life more convenient. People who say computers have made life more complex argue that computers can make fatal error. However, computers are much faster and more sophisticated than humans. \n   Second, computers allow communication with people easier. Nowadays, almost of people have social network service account. They can communicate much more easily through social network service than in the past. Opponents argue that social network service reduces people's direct contact. However, it is true that contact with people has increased significantly compared to the past. Therefore, people can maintain a closer relationship with each other.\n   Third, computers provide a large amount of information. Nowadays, people can easily get information at any time by the Internet. Some opponents argue that people may not be able to make decisions easily based on too much information. However, it is good enough if people select the information well.\n   In conclusion, computers replace human labor, allow communication with people easier and provide a large amount of information. Therefore, the argument that computers have made life easier and more convenient can be persuasive.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's strong argument that computers have made life more convenient, particularly through the example of how they replace human labor; however, the claim could be strengthened by providing more detailed evidence or examples to support this assertion.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents ideas in a logical sequence, but the transition between points could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing labor to communication without a clear linking sentence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors, such as 'there are much controversy' and 'computers have made computers have made life more complex,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

There's much controversy about inventions of computers. There might be some people who believe that the computers make their life more stressful. However, I personally believe that computers brought many benefits and play a very important role in our modern life.\n\n  First of all, they do every task faster. Considering the fact that time is a valuable factor in everyone's life, when you give your computer a job you are sure that it will be done in a blink of an eye and it is not going to take much of your time. For instance, before the computers were invented, we had to do a large number of calculations by hand and not only did it take a lot of energy and effort but also it took a great amount of time to calculate what we needed. But these days these type of calculations are no longer a human's concern. In the fall semester of the university, I had a project in \u201cProgram Language\u201d, a very difficult course with huge and long coding and calculations. Having a laptop and a suitable software on it, I managed to accomplish the project before its deadline. As you can see a computer facilitates and accelerates many works that we used to do by hand.\n\n  Second, they provide various sorts of entertainment for people especially for children. Computers include many video games for different age ranges and a variety of tastes.  When I was in high school, I did not have a laptop for some financial reasons. I was living in dormitory and there were a lot of free times that I did not know how to fill. I had to spend my free time sleeping or staring at the wall. As a result, huge amount of time was wasted and I was often bored and totally confused about what to do specially when I just finished my study and did the assignments. This experience taught me that if you have a computer you can easily fill your spare time with a diverse beneficial software programs on this device.\n\n  Nevertheless many people argue computer make their life more complex and stressful. However I believe that invention of computers is the greatest useful innovation. For this reasons, every company use computers everyday, and they can't do anything without computer's software programs. I can say that we can't live one day without computers.\n\n  In some, even though some people may believe that computers have made life stressful and more complex, but I intensely think that the opposite is true. Note only do they do many jobs faster than ever, but also they provide a large variety of entertainment for human. I advise every office and home to have at least one computer and make a good use of it in its most proper way.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified because the essay presents a clear argument in favor of computers, such as stating that they do tasks faster, but it lacks depth in exploring counterarguments, particularly in the acknowledgment of the stress computers can cause, which is mentioned but not elaborated upon.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by a logical structure that includes an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion; however, the transition between the second and third paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the overall flow of ideas, as it abruptly shifts from entertainment to a broader statement about the necessity of computers.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted due to the effective use of vocabulary and sentence structure, exemplified by phrases like 'a diverse beneficial software programs,' but it contains grammatical errors, such as 'computer make their life more complex,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

The opinions vary depending on personal experiences and background. Some say that computers make life more complex and stressful; but in my opinion, computers make life much easier and convenient.\nThese days, computers are advanced enough that it could assist human in a wide range of tasks. For instance, computers are used as tools for communication via social media and messaging applications. Without computers, there is no other tools that can ease the communication to this caliber using the internet. Moreover, developers has created many applications to make use of a computer to the limit, such as document-editing applications, digital clock, calculator, and calendar. All these applications can make life easier by turning everything to digital. Users no longer need to buy or find an access to tools to make their life easier as computer can act as a multi-purpose tool. As an example, it is cheaper and more convenient to use a timer on a phone than buying a watch and use it as a timer. Furthermore, with the internet, everything can be done online: shopping, watching movies, file storage, etc. Although users may not have the exact same experience of actually doing these tasks, it is less time-consuming and more convenient to do them online.\nEven though some may say that computers make life more stressful, it mostly depends on the job and person rather than the computers themselves. For example, jobs like programmers that mainly use computer can be really stressful, but it is due to the task that they are doing using the computers. It is agreeable that the computers are complicated, but so as any other tools, it takes time to get used to and fully gain advantages out of it. People with a lot of experiences with any tools, they often find that the tool is very useful and easy to use. In addition, computers can help relieve stress. With computers and internet, users can easily access entertainment like games and movies. \nTo conclude, rather than make life more complex and stressful, computers make life easier and more convenient. Some could say that computers make life more complex and stressful, but it is due to themselves and their experiences for not getting used to it and not being able to understand the convenience that computers could bring.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 5.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 14.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 5.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument that computers make life easier and convenient, supported by specific examples such as the use of document-editing applications and online shopping.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 5.0 is warranted because the essay is well-structured, with a logical flow from introducing the topic to presenting examples and concluding with a strong summarization of the main argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate due to some grammatical errors, such as 'developers has created' instead of 'developers have created,' which slightly detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

One of the most crucial changes is related to the improvements of computers which become nearly the most essential thing in daily life. The issue of whether computers have made life easier and more convenient or made it more complex and stressful has always been a hot topic over decades. Although many people argue that computers are changing life in a more sophisticated and stressful way, I still believe in the opposite direction where it actually makes our lives easier for the following reasons.\n  First, it can be seen that computers are having human dealing with complex tasks which happens everyday in the modern life. Computers appears almost in every field of work ranging from factory and company to school. For example, engineers can use computers for coding to control robots in factory that enhance the accuracy in producing products. The work that human can make errors are now replacing by the hand of robots which increase the efficiency and profits for many companies. Thus, computers help reducing the labor workforce and supporting human with providing quality products.\n  Another beneficial factor that computers help us is they faster the way people communicate each other. Nowadays, people can call their friends and relatives over the internet faster than before due to the improvements of computers. In addition, the way individuals exchanging letters also different comparing to the past. If in the past people had to wait over months for letters to be transfered, now they can just simple write their emails in few minutes and send them over internet for just few seconds.\n  Despite the positive reinforcement of my idea, some people still claim that computers make our lives harder because they make work around us more complex. However, I should say that we work to make others lives happier. If we can see our friends or parents can live happily in this sophisticated world, then the enhancement of computers to make those things reality is worth, right? Computers help the lives of our relatives become more convenient.\n  In conclusion, it is true that computers are actually trying to provide human with more convenient life. Although the hard things can appear sometimes in our lives, we should continue move on and trying our best to contribute to the development of technology especially computers to make others people in this world live easier.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 5.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 14.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively argues that computers make life easier, as evidenced by the example of engineers using computers to control robots, but it lacks depth in discussing counterarguments, which weakens the overall persuasive impact.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is well-organized with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that support the main argument, and a concise conclusion, making it easy to follow the writer's line of reasoning.\nJustification for Language: While the essay demonstrates a good command of language, it contains grammatical errors such as 'computers appears' and 'to be transfered,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. \n\nEssay to evaluate:\nBy the importance of studying at universities has arised recently, there has been immense discussions arguing about wheather requiring students to take classes in many subjects is better or specializing in one subject is better. Both opinions of each sides are outstanding. I would like to stand on the side of requiring sepcialization in one subject to students since, first, strong specialization in one subject has benefits , second, taking classes in many subjects requires immense time, and last, specializing is more efficeint than the other.\n First, having specialization in one subject has benefits after graduation. Most students will find for jobs after graduating to earn money. As high quality job requires high knowledge or profession, specializing in one's major will have an advantage. If students take calsses in diverse majors, their knowledge might be diverse but depth won't follow. Since our society wants depth rather than variation, working hard in on major is an appropriate method for students. In addition, most universities gather students with certain majors and have seperated departments like department of electrical engineering or department of social science. This feature of universities support the idea that specialization is important. \n Second, immense time is required for taking classes in diverse subjects. Most universities are scheduled to graduate after attending for four years; which means, there is no enough time. Even if a student registers a lot more courses than the others, it might fail to achive all the courses successfully as there are lots of things to do, but the time is limited. Some might argue that attend more years at university will be the solution, but students have to go through the next step of their own career. They cannot study at university for whole time. \n For the last, specializing in one major is more efficeint in studying. If one studies many subjects, most of contents students learns are seperated. On the other hand, studies in on magor are all connected like a map. Knowledge obtained from a particular lectrue will used to the following lecture and courses. Therefore, majoring is efficeint than studying many subjects. \n In conclusion, universities requiring students to specialize in one subject is better than the other. Of course, it is the problem for the university to decide, for the reason of benefits after graduation, limited time and efficeincy, specializing is helpful.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified because while the essay presents a clear argument in favor of specialization, it lacks depth in discussing counterarguments, as seen in the phrase 'Some might argue that attend more years at university will be the solution,' which is not elaborated upon.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct paragraphs for each main point; however, the transitions between ideas could be improved, as the shift from discussing job advantages to time constraints feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted due to generally clear expression, but the frequent spelling errors such as 'wheather,' 'sepcialization,' and 'efficeint' detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Both opinions of each side and their bases are truly outstanding, but I'd like to argue on the side of computers have made life easier and more convenient.\n First of all, computers have rased work efficiency highly in almost every profession. In simple tasks, by automation and fast processing speed, computers can complete a task in seconds which takes days to complete for a person to work. About 50 lines of program codes can finish a task which 50 person does, even more faster. Even in complex tasks which essentially requires a person, computers can help people work much efficiently by lots of supporting programs.\n Second, computers are playing a big role in education. Easy accessibility of data by internet technology has made students' education much more efficient. Rather than using only limited information and pictures on a textbook, teachers can also use a huge amount of media on the internet. With the development of AR technology, students now can not only imagine the shape of a Tyrannosaurus via text information on a book, but they can also see the realistic 3D-Live video of a Tyrannosaurus through their cameras.\n Moreover, Artificial intelligence and Deep-learnig technology can liberate humanity free from labor. Now A.I can do most of things which people used to do, and by the development of technology, it will soon take most of the hard and difficult, dangerous work people used to do.\n To sum up, computer technologies have made life much convenient. Some might say that there may be some problems by the developments of computer technology, such as game addiction and job losses, but I think the positive side of the developments are much more to humanity.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument in favor of computers making life easier, supported by examples like the efficiency of automation in the workplace, but it lacks a deeper exploration of counterarguments, such as the mention of potential negative impacts like game addiction and job losses without adequate elaboration.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified because the essay follows a logical structure with clear transitions between points, such as moving from work efficiency to the role of computers in education, but it could improve by including more explicit topic sentences to guide the reader through each section.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is justified as the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and sentence structure, but it contains noticeable errors such as 'rased' instead of 'raised' and 'Deep-learnig' instead of 'Deep-learning', which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Because it can make very fast and very accurate calculation, it could be applied to many field and made huge differences in various aspects. It is also applied to our ordinary life. As computer became more and more advanced, our life has been changed according to such change. However, there is some conflicts about does it made our life more easier. Although some people say that computer made our life much more complicated, I think it made our life definitely easier.\n The first reason is about its multi function. One example is video. Before computer, the major media was the pictures and texts in the paper. To watch the movie, or other kinds of videos, people should go to the theater. For common people, it was hard to watch such videos easily because watching videos required very complicated and expensive equipment. However, after the development of computer, it became more easier to watch such videos. There are many video player in our computer like gom player or windows media player, and they does not require complicated knowledge. Some opponent may say that there is also some problems in those players like video codec problem, but the programs automatically give solutions to such problems. Also, the development of information technology enabled online video platforms like Youtube, and it is much more easier that such players. As a result, such players and platforms made watching videos much easier. Like video, many other process like illustration or copying became much easier thanks to computer's easy programs.\n The second reason is about information. Before the development of the computer science, the major source of information was newspaper of journals. The number of such medias was limited, and not opened to all people around the world. For example the people in Korea could not see New York times easily, and such differences could occur according to the person's social position. Compared to these old information sources, computer is very convenient. The web browsers like Google have enormous amount of information in its server data, and we cam find these data with just one click. Now, people don't have to read library index to find information because the computer find information with its fast calculation.\n The last reason is that consumers don't have to understand the complex principles of computer. A few opponents say that the mechanism of such programs is very complicated, so when their is problem, it is hard to understand the problem and hard to find solution. But mostly, we don't have to find such solution manually. Most of the solutions is automatically drawn by the program. Although the program does not give precise solutions, people can just follow the solution on internet. Of course, there can be some errors which is very hard to get information about the problem and solution. In this case, however, people just go to the offline A/S center and follow the way of experts. There are no needs for the mechanisms for the program.\n To sum up, computer made our life more easier in aspects of its function, information, and problem solving. Thanks to it, our life became more easier. We need to be more appreciate for such technological development\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents clear arguments about how computers have made life easier, such as discussing the convenience of video players and online platforms like YouTube, but it lacks depth in exploring potential counterarguments more thoroughly.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is reasonable because the essay follows a logical structure, with clear topic sentences for each paragraph, although transitions between ideas could be smoother to enhance overall coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and sentence structure, but it contains several grammatical errors, such as 'made our life more easier' instead of 'made our life easier,' which detracts from clarity."}]}

Some people claim that computers have made life complex and stressful. On the other hand, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient, because of information accessible through the internet, globalization.\n First of all, Some argue that countless information including private information is opened on the internet even though people want. On the other hand, information and knowledge in the various areas are accessible via the internet. In the past, information was exchanged by letters or face to face meeting. Furthermore, a lot of knowledge was learned from books. However, since the internet has developed in the world, people can easily ask about the recent situation of friends and families. Also, by sharing knowledge in the media, a lot of students can get opportunities for learning. Even though inevitable information can be opened, convenient accessibility of information via the internet give people more interactive relations and educational opportunities. \n Next, computers have made the world globalized. Through the various interactions with other countries, people can get an interest in other countries' cultures. For example, BTS from South Korea could be famous all over the world since their music videos and performance videos are spread fast through SNS such as Twitter and YouTube.

Some argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, yet some others oppose to that opinion. I believe that computers have made our life easier and more convenient for couple of reasons.\n; it is available to do complex works, it is easy to record, and it people must follow the development of technology.\n    Firstly, the computers have made it available to do complex works that cannot be done by human. Works such as making charts, calculating and solving complex problems, and editing pictures and videos are the complex works that cannot be conducted or too hard to do without computers. For example, nowadays computers calculate the infinite number 'pi' to the tremendous number of digits. Additionally, it is easy to justify this reason even not looking at the history before the computer has been invented. By comparing the capability between the computer of 2000 and 2020, the complex works mentioned above are now done in much less time.\n    Second, the computers allows to record everything easily. Before the computers were invented, people needed to record everything by writing on a paper with a pen or by using typing machine and print on a paper right away. In this method, people should have made copies by repeating the same work in order to save the document safely. However, data on the computer do not get ripped, burnt, or wet and vanish. In some cases, the data can be destroyed by some possibilities; the possibilities are situations like light out or error of the computer itself. Nevertheless, using the internet network through computer will help to save the data in the cloud service which is safe from it.\n     Even there are advantages of computers such as things mentioned before, some argue that people who didn't learn computer cannot do anything. However, following the flow of technology development is inevitable in modern society: Learning computers are thing that must be done in this society.\n    To sum up, computers have made people's life more convenient in the stance of works that can be done with computers and the stability of saving the data. Some might believe that those advantages are useless without learning computers, so it had made life more complex, but it is true that people should learn and follow the development. For these reasons, I think that there are more advantages given by computers than disadvantages.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score is strong at 4.5/5 because the essay effectively presents multiple arguments supporting the idea that computers have made life easier, such as the ability to perform complex calculations and store data safely, though it could benefit from more specific examples or evidence to strengthen its claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score is also 4.5/5 as the essay is structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on a specific point, and a conclusion, but the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly in the shift between the second and third points.\nJustification for Language: The language score is rated at 4.5/5 due to the generally clear and coherent use of language, although there are instances of awkward phrasing, such as 'the computers allows to record everything easily,' which should have been 'computers allow us to record everything easily.'"}]}

The machine, which has overwhelming computing Speed, already takes over human for several works. For exmaple, in the past, to improve the \nproductivity, many companys higher engineers to their factory and study for the better proccess; however, nowaday, the super computer and its maching learning algorithms makes much more productivity compare to the human developers. These phenomenon contunes to the decrease of several jobs. In the extreme perspective, people argue that computers and robots will replace every human job. Though there are negative evaluations for the computer, serveral positive effects of the computer also exist; and, it is sufficient to ignore the negative side of the computer. The computer makes two major benefits: generation of the new occupation and scientifical evolution.\n    It is obvious that some works are replaced by computer. However, much more occupations, which are realated to the develop of the computer its' applications, will generate and the total number of jobs will increase. In the hictrocal viewpoint, steam engine is the simmilar example. When the steam engine is invented, many laborers oppose to adoption of the machine; however, finally, the machine made a huge amount of improvement on the production and it is called the Second Industrial Evolution nowadays. People who believe the efficincy made a simmliar word, the Fourth Industrial Evolution. The evolution will lead us to equal or more improvment of the productivity, which is highly relative to our life benefits.\n\n    (3rd paragraph, about scientifical evolution)\n\n    In summary, the compter give us industral and scientifical innovations. These benefits will provide us new jobs, new technologies, and new societies. It is obvious that the computer's high performance is essential to the modern society.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 1.5/5\nOrganization: 2.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 7.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 1.5 is justified because the essay presents a weak argument, as seen in the vague claim that 'the computer makes two major benefits: generation of the new occupation and scientifical evolution' without providing substantial evidence or examples to support these points.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.0 is warranted because the essay lacks a clear structure, particularly evident in the abrupt transition to the third paragraph labeled 'scientifical evolution' without any context or development of ideas leading into it.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 reflects some effective communication, but it is undermined by numerous spelling and grammatical errors, such as 'spped' instead of 'speed' and 'higher engineers' instead of 'hire engineers,' which detract from overall clarity."}]}

On the other hand, my sister played a lot and had many different interesting things when she was younger age. My sister is now playing cello which she was good at when she was young, and she is more creative than me.\n\nsecond, children can find their ability and set his/her dream. Few years ago, studying hard and having a job that can be obtained by higher grade at school was the only answer of successful life. However, it is no longer the answer. Recently, there are many jobs that does't need higher grades at school such as math, science, Korean, and is became a succesful job and that talent can be found on younger age.\n\nThird, there is no time to play in teenager age, so that children must play. In Korean education system, teenagers have to study most of their time in daily life. If children don't spend their time to play, then they will not able to have time to play until 20s.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 8.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects the lack of depth and clarity in the supporting arguments, as seen in the vague statement about success not requiring higher grades, which is not sufficiently explained or supported with examples.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is justified by the essay's overall structure, which has a clear introductory statement and three points, but it suffers from a lack of smooth transitions and coherence between ideas, particularly in the abrupt shift between the second and third points.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'is became a succesful job,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Then what should we do on childhood? Some people think that children should begin their formal education at very early age and spend most of their time on school studies. Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. I think that young children should spend most of their time playing.\n    First of all, we all have diffrent talents.  Young children can find their talent when they are playing. For example, a child who could be a great soccer player may find talent when playing soccer. If the child spends most of their time on school studies, then big opportunity will vanish. Most adults do not know what they really like. Some of them work for just money. However when they examine what they really like on childhood,  they can select their job better. \n    The other reason for spending most of  time playing is that  children may burn out. In 21th century, we study until we dead. The wolrd changes so rapidly that we need to adjust ourselves to the world. It means that we need to prepare for learning. If we begin our formal education at very ealry age, then we may be tired on some point. It could be on highschool,  on university, or when we get job.  It makes hard to long run. If children spend most of their time playing, then they may be bored on some point. From that point, they are ready to learn something.\n    Therefore  yoong children should spend most of their time playing because of finding their talent and preventing burn out. Nowadays, school education is not the unique way to survive. There are a lot of other things to do. Finding what they really like is the most important thing to live.  So, ejoying childhood is more valuable. One can find it when they are adult. However, If you experience it early, then you can save a lot of time.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 8.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified because while the essay presents a clear opinion that children should spend their time playing, it lacks depth in arguments, as seen in the assertion that 'if the child spends most of their time on school studies, then big opportunity will vanish,' which is vague and underdeveloped.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 reflects a lack of clear structure, illustrated by the abrupt transition between ideas, such as moving from discussing talent to burnout without a cohesive linking sentence, making the flow of the essay difficult to follow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'in 21th century' and 'ealry age,' which detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nYoung children have to spend most of their time playing. Let me show several reason for that.\nFirst, young children have a large amount of curiosity and energy. They love running to somewhere, touching something new, and hanging with someone. However, they never want to sit down and read a book, or pay attention to their teacher. It is not a good choice for them such that forcing them to go to school and sit down on their 'fixed' seat at a very early age because it will make them depressed.\nSecond, young children do not know why they have to go to school, why they have to looking a book or teacher in front of them and why they have to learn some strange things. In short, they do not know the reason why they study. At early age, it is better to experience a lot of things which can satisfy their infinite curiosity. Then, they will find the reason why they have to study and go to school.\nLastly, very young childs are usually afraid of being apart from their parents. Even for some children at normal age to go to primary school, it is hard job to being apart form their parents. They need to more time to grow mentally with their parent in their very young age. \nIn short, very young children are too active to sit in a class. Also they do not know why they should study and some of them do not want to leave their parent yet. For these reasons, it is better for the young childeren to spend more time playing, rather than going to school at a very early age.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 8.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified as the essay provides some relevant reasons for the argument, such as young children's curiosity and fear of separation from parents, but lacks depth and specific examples to support the claims, like failing to elaborate on how play contributes to learning.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 is warranted as the essay presents ideas in a somewhat disjointed manner, with unclear transitions between points, such as the abrupt shift from discussing curiosity to the need for parental presence without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 reflects the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'being apart form their parents' and 'it is hard job to being apart,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nI agree that the children should spend most of their time playing. There are 3 reasons. First of all, in whole life, there is very enough time to studying. Especially, if you get old, you may have lot of remaining time to do something. You can study at that time. Also at that time, you can study what you want so you can enjoy studying. However  most of children do not know what they want to know or study. This is second reason. Childern just study something they do not want to know because someone such like parents want they study hard and get a good grade. So they study without their own willingness. It implies that large portion of children do not want to study. In real case, when I was young, most of my friends do not want study. So the memory when they young become bad memories. Everyone knows that memory of young time is very important in whole life because it can affect their job, hobby and even future. So at that time children should do various experiences to make good memory and find their way of life. But only studying can gives only bad memories and bad effects to children. Conversely, playing implies various things so it can give good memories and good effects to them. So they should spend most of their time playing. Last reason is that if you get old you cannot spend time playing even though you want to because of your body condition. Human's body is getting old and old rapidly. So if you get old, your body also get old and finally you cannot do some playing which demands physical requirements. So you should play something when you are young. Those are 3 reasons that yound children should spend most of time playing. Only studying cannot make good adults. It just reduce way of life. \nHowever, playing can increase the way of life. So I recommend you to make your children spending lot of time playing.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 2.0/5\nLanguage: 2.0/5\nOverall Score: 6.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay presents vague reasons, such as stating that 'most of children do not know what they want to know or study' without providing specific examples or evidence to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.0 is warranted because the essay lacks clear structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner, such as jumping from the discussion of children's memories to the physical limitations of aging without smooth transitions.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.0 is justified due to numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, evident in sentences like 'in whole life, there is very enough time to studying,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

I believe this is true because, children can learn variety of things while playing, which cannot be earned by beginning formal education early. He\nTo begin with, while playing, children can learn some values that cannot be covered by the formal education. Formal education is quite efficient in teaching  children some selected courses. However, it doesn't cover the important things that are far more valuable in the rest of the life. Some examples of such values can be honesty, sociality, confidence,  etc. One might argue that these values can be taught in formal eduaction also, but I strongly disagree on that point. These values are not learnt by the lecture, but are acquired by the natural context of the experience.    \nLast and most importantly, children can find what they are interested in while playing.  Once again, formal education is quite efficient in teaching children some regular courses. However, it does not teach children what specific field to get interested in,  or how to  set a goal.  If  children starts their formal eduaction earlier, some of them may go over and over lectures what they believe as meaningless, without having a actual interest  or goal . I believe this is really dangerous. In the early age, it is very important to experience how to set goals based on their own interest, and pursue them. \nTo sum up, comparing to the early start of formal education,  playing is much more valuable in the early ages. Children can learn wider range of things, and also find their interest and set goals while playing.  \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 8.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5/5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay provides limited examples to support its claims, such as when it mentions 'honesty, sociality, confidence, etc.' without elaborating on how these values specifically relate to play versus formal education.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0/5 is justified by the essay's clear structure, but it suffers from abrupt transitions and vague phrasing, such as the lack of a clear thesis statement and the awkward phrasing in 'I stands for the view that...', which disrupts the flow of ideas.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5/5 is warranted due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward word choices, as seen in sentences like 'some of them may go over and over lectures what they believe as meaningless', which diminish clarity and coherence."}]}

Formal education can improve intellectual ability of children. However, it teaches stereotyped things, so degrades the creativity.  Creativity creates when someone encounter a variety of things such as listening the music, see the greatness of nature and so on. Formal education does not teach these raw things, but it teaches the processed knowledge. The stereotyped knowledge makes children grow into  a stereotyped person and it degrades children's creativity.\nAnother reason is related to children's happiness. For example, in Korea, there is a lot of private education when childhood.  Korean students who grew up like this have very high academic performance. On the other hand, Korea has the highest suicide rate among OECD countries. The cause of teenage suicide is mostly academic stress. If children get formal education at an early age, academic competitiveness also increases at earlier time. It would be really unforunate to live this life as a teenager  who can grow up with anything. \nEach child has different talents and has different growth possibilities. Starting formal education at a very early age reduces children's growth potential, creativiy and happiness. For these reasons, I disagree early formal education and agree with the idea of spending more time playing.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay's argument against early formal education is supported by relevant examples, such as the mention of Korea's high suicide rate among students, but lacks depth and specific evidence to strengthen its claims.\nJustification for Organization: The essay presents its ideas in a somewhat coherent manner, yet the flow between points is hindered by abrupt transitions, such as the jump from discussing creativity to the issue of happiness without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language used in the essay contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'I agree with children should spend most of their time playing,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Following this, many companies and nations need highly educated people to innovate their techniques. Because of that, many parents want to make their children study more than others  and it causes many arguments. In this writing, I want to mention my opinion about the argument \"Which case is better between child playing and education?\". To simply say, I think former one is better and have two reasons of it. (Young children should spend most of their time playing) \n The first reason why I thought like that is that playing is one of the way of studying. Studying doesn't mean only reading, writing, solving something. Before learning those, children need to learn how to hang out with their friends and how to communicate and collaborate each other. These learning is originated from playing.\n Second, young children whose age is about 4~7(Korean age) are not ready to go school because they are not matured. If they learn something before maturity, they will take hard time. It leads decline of interest of learning and finally causes to give up to learn difficult things such as math, foreign languages. \n In child stage, it is much more important to learn social relationship rather than school studies. Even though I agree with some aspect why they are worried about lagging behind, I can definitely say that children should play for preparation their own future.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 7.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects the lack of depth in the argument, as the essay states that 'playing is one of the way of studying' without providing substantial evidence or examples to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 is justified by the essay's unclear structure, as it jumps between ideas without clear transitions, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the importance of play to the maturity of children with no clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'the former one is better and have two reasons of it,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nThere are a lot of children who start their formal education earlier than optimal age. Most of them study because of their  parent's will. However, young children should spend most of their time playing.\nFirst,  learning at too early age can make adverse effect.  Early education can decrease desire for education. Most of children who takes early education study because their parents want. So, children who take early education can lose their self-learning ability. This means they study because they feel obliged in education, not they want to do. If children lose their interest in education, they would feel exhausted and want to break away from education in the future. \nEducation in optimal age is enough. There are a lot of students who get good grades without any early education. Early education can be helpful for getting preliminary knowledge. However, getting good grade or using knowledge for work in future is distinguished from effort  of theirselves. So, early education without children's self-effort would not be effective. If students do their best for education in optimal age, they can make good result and also use their knowledge well in the future.\nTime to play gets less as reaching old age. There are a lot of things to do when children become adult. So, early age can be only time to play without any trivial thoughts. Children can get pleasant memory by playing so it would be helpful for formation of self-identity.\nIn conclusion, children should spend most of their time playing, not on early education. Early education can make some bad effects and education in optimal age is enough. Also, time to paly gets less as reaching old age. I hope that many children can spend their time playing so they can enjoy their early age life.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as seen in the claim that 'learning at too early age can make adverse effect' without providing strong evidence or specific examples to support this assertion.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is justified by the essay's unclear transition between ideas, particularly in the shift from discussing the effects of early education to the importance of play, which disrupts the flow of the argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'Most of children who takes early education study because their parents want,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Due to the enforcement of them, Korean students usually start being educated very early from about 5 or 6 years old. I guess the purpose of that kind of education is focused on the enterance to the high level university which is believed to be related to the success of life. In order to be the student of S.K.Y. student, individuals need to get highest grade from their highschool. Since the coverage of the sighschool education is vast, becomming the summa cum laude means the whole comprehensions for every subjects with full of knowledge and informations. This cause the requirment of studying the course in highschool before the highschool. Thus to introduce the knowledge of highschool, the middle school coverages should be already understood by him or her and so on and so on. \nSince now, the early-education strategy seems to work some extent, however there are some severe problems with it. First, students do not have the passion to study. Student who has mechanically done with their learning with the press of their parents might easily have the mide opposing the pressure. All the peaple had eagerness for the freedom. Freedom from the pressure of study would not work positively for the personal improvement via studying. Second, students who learned the concept before become less participating student of actual class. This leads to a bad habbit of not listening to person. For instance, In usual Korean highschool, 90% of the students sleeps during the class. It would weaken the deliver of the educational intention.  And lastly, student assumed to be the highest-level university student lose thier dream and waste thier time instead of the hard working to improve themselves or to contribute to the world or society. I have many friends with same problems. They just studied as what their parents said and believed the dream their parents provided. However, experiences they made in university indicates they does not fit in to the major or researcher society. Some of them regret their past times just following the advices and live with liquor and computer games. It is very bad for themselves  and to society both.\nFor those reasons, I disagree with the early-education.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.0/5\nOverall Score: 7.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects the essay's limited depth of analysis, as seen in the assertion that 'students do not have the passion to study' without providing sufficient evidence or examples to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 is justified by the lack of clear transitions between ideas, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the negative impacts of early education to the personal anecdotes about friends, which disrupts the overall flow of the argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.0 is warranted due to numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'the biggest issue of the Korean parents thesedays is the early-education,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

First, children should find out what they want to do for playing. Children do not know what they like to do, because they don't have much experience. Kids become to know themselves for playing, such as playing soccer, playing the piano, and watching a movie. If children begin their formal education at a very early age, they are really hard to find their goal. Second, playing helps to develop creativity. Formal education is exactly formal. It is just for basic knowledge, not for creativity. Children could enhance their creativity reading books, playing and so on. Last, playing helps to grow friendship. Generally, children study alone when they do formal educaiton. They don't have much time to spend with their friends. However, they can join with friends natually for playing. Growing friendship is helpful for children's social life. I agree with that kids should play rather than spend most of their time on school studies. Because playing help to know themselves, to enhance creativity, and to grow friendship. A lot of korean parenets believe that begining formal education at a very early age is important to succeed. I wish they become to know that playing is important as much as study for success.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 7.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 is justified as the essay presents three reasons for the importance of play, but lacks depth and development, such as the vague statement 'Kids become to know themselves for playing' which does not clearly explain how play aids self-discovery.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 is warranted because the essay follows a basic structure but lacks clear transitions and logical flow, evidenced by the abrupt shift from discussing creativity to friendship without a cohesive link between the two points.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is appropriate due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'begin their formal education at a very early age, they are really hard to find their goal,' which hinders clarity and overall understanding."}]}

Also, creative playing is more important for young children, so I agree with the opinion which young children should most of their time playing.\nFirst, young children does not have enough language skills to learn formal education. Almost class in formal education must need the textbook. However, it may be hard to read the letters on the textbook for very young children. I think young children should more focus on the learning the basic language skills.\nSecond, young children will may not be work against the homework and study stress. A lot of formal educations, teacher give some homework and test to student. For example, I already do the test now in the advanced writing class. The responsibilities for the class such as participation, homework, and test are required for student. However, these kind of responsibilities are too heavy for young children. Even though it is very stressful for adult. \nLastly, we can expect the true learning in the creative playing. The knowledge which they learned in formal education is very useful to entering university. However, it is not good for the young children. They should first learn how to think creatively. Playing is very helpful to experience various situations and environment. \nTo summarize, it is more important that young children should spend most of their time playing.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 8.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects the essay's limited exploration of the argument, as the claim that creative play is more important than formal education is not sufficiently supported with specific examples or evidence, such as when the author states, 'young children should more focus on the learning the basic language skills' without elaborating on how this benefits their development.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is justified by the essay's lack of clear transitions and a cohesive structure, particularly evident in the abrupt shift from discussing language skills to homework stress, which disrupts the flow of the argument and makes it difficult for the reader to follow the main points.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, as seen in sentences like 'young children does not have enough language skills' and 'these kind of responsibilities are too heavy for young children,' which hinder clarity and readability."}]}

I think this culture is not efficient for children's education. First of all, study in the school is more efficient. Because, when you take the course at the same time in school and academy, school teachers are better than academy teachers. All exam problems are held from the school teachers. Second, it is helpful for growing social relationship by playing with friends when they're young. Children should be familiar with debating, get relationships.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nNowadays, an average  degree of people became higher. Therefore, lots of people study hard to get a good degree. And even young children begin their formal education at a very early age. For this issue, there are two big view: children should begin their formal education at a very early stage, young children should spend most of their time playing. For me, the person who experienced the formal education at a very early age, I agree that young children should spend most of their time playing. There are two specific reasons that support my thought.\n First reason is that the time at a very early age is the only free-time to play without any pressure or stress. As children grow up, they naturally have to study. So,  if young children begin formal study at the early age, they may have to study later on without pressure-free time. Also, playing at the time at a very early age could make people more focus on their study without regreting.\nSecond, children at early age should experience the world to construct their thoughts and ego. The early stage of human is crucial for constructing their own perspective. And an experience in the early stage cannot be replace with other. So, they need to play and experience various stimuli instead of studying and sitting on a chair. \n Beginning formal education at a very early age may help children to get better understanding on future studies. However, I think the chance of getting pressure -free time and  getting more experience about the world is more important than that.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nI think the children should spend most of their time playing. Here are several reasons why I think so.\n First, There is not a lot knowledge that can be educated in childhood. Before the children go to elementary school or the lower grade in elementary school, there is not many thing to educate. They don't educate complex mathematics, science, etc, but they learn the basic attitude, sociability, and basic thinking power. Because they learn the basic thing to leave in society, not a complex things, It is not a thing that only can educate in school. They can learn it when he or she playing with other childrean, and they can learn it from their parents. It doesn't have to be learn from school.\n\n Second, the children can learn more in real experience. I think sociability and attitude is the first valuable thing to learn in childhood. And that things are different from knowledge like mathematics, their ability can improve from real experience. There is a popular proverb in Korea, 'One real experience is better than a hundred words'. This proverb says the importance of real experience. I think the efficient way to improve children's ability like sociability or attitude, is not spend time in school, but spend that time on playing with friends or communicating with their family.\n Nowadays, there is family that can't spend a lot of time with their children. There is several reasons, like two parents are working, or bad condition of family. Exceptionally, on these case, their children can educate better on school than on home alone. But not the case like mentioned before, I think the time that playing with friends, or communicate with their family is more valuable than spend time on school studies for young children like children before he or she go to elementary school.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 7.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay asserts that children can learn important skills through play but provides limited examples or evidence to support this claim, such as the vague reference to 'basic attitude' and 'sociability' without clear explanations or illustrations.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 is justified by the essay's weak structure, which lacks clear topic sentences and logical transitions between ideas, making it difficult for readers to follow the flow of the argument, as seen in the abrupt shift from the importance of play to the mention of family circumstances.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'before he or she go to elementary school' and 'it doesn't have to be learn from school,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

In my opinion, it is more efficient to use time in playing than studying something in very early age.\nFirst of all, the knowledge in very early age isn\u2019t efficient. Young children do not have any background knowledge and thinking skills, formal education will be not helpful to them. Also, knowledge in early age can be fogetten easily more than the knowledge in older age. In my case, I also took some edcations but it wasn\u2019t useful to me and I couldn\u2019t remeber most of them.\nSecondly, spending time in playing when they are very young, it can be very positive effect to them. Most of people don\u2019t know what they want to in future. But if children do a lot of experences and activities in their early age, they can get thoughts about what they like, what they want to do. In my experences, I keep dreamed a mechanichal engineer from my early age. It\u2019s because I had a lot of interests in making something, so I made such as rubber band guns, water rockets, and gliders myself in remaining time after school.\nFinally, young children have to feel a lot of emtional things. It could be feel like stuck when they have to study all day. It is related to their feelings. Knowledge is also need for chidren, but building their personality is more important to children in ealry age. It determines the entire life.\nFor these reasons, I think that young children should spend more their time in playing.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 8.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the claim that 'knowledge in very early age isn\u2019t efficient' is not sufficiently supported with evidence or examples beyond personal anecdote, which weakens the overall argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is justified as the essay has a basic structure with an introduction and conclusion, but the transition between ideas is often unclear, such as the abrupt shift from discussing the inefficiency of early knowledge to the importance of emotional experiences without clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to frequent spelling and grammatical errors, such as 'belive' instead of 'believe' and 'fogetten' instead of 'forgotten,' which detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

This is based on my personal beliefs.\n First, I belive that everyone is borned with special gifts. Some kids are naturally interested in numbers, some are great at being funny. Everyone has something to offer but formal education will never be good enough to take this into consideration. We need to give children the freedom to explore themselves and find their own gifts. We should never force future generation to pursue the virtue of current generation. The world is changing faster than ever.  Basic knowleges are not as valuable as before.\n In the past, the purpose of formal education was to educate the common knowlege even for those who are not lucky enough to get it elsewhere.  However, nowadays it is a system that elicit extreme competition where grades hang like a catter.  Parents do everything to make their kids win the competition. No matter what it takes, how much is costs, they educate their kids to win. I see this as an insult to human dignity. The value of kindness, happiness, courage, creativity is not something given as a result  of a race but something we should always keep. Look at all those tired faces. Our society is ill.\n Maybe, formal education in materialistic society is destined to be like this. We must help children to learn the true values before they start this mad race. If not, they will grow up to be a monster. I believe the most efficient way of doing this is to play. Whatever makes them happy! Communicate with friends. Having silly debates time to time. Traveling with their loved ones. Learning without getting grades. These memories will motivate them to be a better person and will be the most precious resource when they are struggling to be who they are.\n Formal education should start after children already learned the most important things about life. We need people who know themselves, because they are the ones who will make the world a better place.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 8.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects the essay's reliance on personal beliefs without substantial evidence or examples to support its claims, such as the assertion that 'formal education will never be good enough' without elaborating on this point.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 is justified by the lack of clear transitions between ideas and paragraphs, making it difficult to follow the argument, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing the value of play to criticizing the education system without a cohesive link.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is indicated by several spelling and grammatical errors, such as 'belive' instead of 'believe' and 'catter' instead of 'matter,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

I define 'early age' as age under seven. I think that children should begin formal education at least 5 years olds and they should spend most of their time on school studies. \n First, 'early age' is the most important period of life. There is 'Old habits die hard'. It means it has a high probability that habits at young age maintain forever.  From this saying, we can realize that the formation of habits at an 'early age' is important. If we don't teach several rule or education at 'early age', children can have a hard time to adjust to small society like school. \n Second, study efficiency is very high at 'early age'. At five to seven age, it is period that the brain develop a lot.  So, if we activate their brain a lot at that period, they can study effectively afterwards.   \n Finally, formal education  doesn't means just strict study. Education can cover up several courses such as play with friends(cooperation or compertition). if goverment manage it at the national level, we can deal with systematic.\n So far, we can check why we have to formal education at least 5 years old. If this system is universally applied, I think that there will be a better future. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 7.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects the lack of depth in the argument, as the essay mentions that 'there is 'Old habits die hard'' without adequately explaining how this relates to the importance of formal education at an early age.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 is warranted because the essay lacks clear transitions between ideas, such as moving abruptly from discussing the importance of early habits to the efficiency of learning, which disrupts the flow of the argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is justified as the essay contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'doesn't means just strict study,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

In my opinion, I believe that children should spend more time on playing, and my opinion can be demonstrated by  the reasons addressed below.\n\n    Firstly,  forming relationship and sociality is more important to the children rather than studying knowledges. In other words, it is more significant to children to form the sociality and relationship, such as courtesy and conversation with their buddies, parents, and neighbors to assimilate on the human society. Studying knowledges, such as linguistics and mathematics are sufficient to learn after forming sociality.\n\n    Moreover, the reminiscences that formed in childhood by playing can play the significant role on forming ego formation. That is to say, children can find their personality and bias during playing freely. For instance, children themselves can find what they want and love to do, so that they can learn how to develop their talent by themselves.\n\n    Finally, Parents can also figure out their childrens\u2019 disposition. That observation can help parents to instruct their children more desirable way. Studying the knowledgements could be done after finding the aptitude of childrens. Moreover, parents can set the ambient to enhance their childrens\u2019 talents, for instance, playing violin, soccer, et cetera.\n\n    In conclusion, children should spend more time on playing to form the sociality, ego, and finding the talent. Studying in the school is enough after playing on their childhood.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 8.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects a lack of depth in the arguments presented, as seen in the statement 'Studying knowledges, such as linguistics and mathematics are sufficient to learn after forming sociality,' which oversimplifies the educational needs of children and undermines the importance of academic learning.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is justified by the essay's loose structure, particularly in the transition between ideas, as the use of 'Moreover' at the beginning of the second point does not effectively connect it to the previous argument about social relationships.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in 'the reminiscences that formed in childhood by playing can play the significant role on forming ego formation,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nI agree children should start their formal education at a very early age.  There are three reasons.\nFirst of all, children have more chance to learn many things by going a school earlier. Schools give a lot of opportunities to experience marvelous things. They can learn mathematics, but also do experiments which children had not experienced yet. They can exercise with friends. They can explore the nature safely with teacher, and improve their curiousity by taking big experiments. \nSecondly, more younger, they can accept more easily. I think I have accepted new things in more open mind in early ages than in present.  When I saw new things in a child, I tried to make them to my own things, and it has been memoriable. But at present, it is hard for me to accept new things fully than childhood. If I could go back to a very early age, I would do many funny things, and try to learn more. So, I think children need to go a school at a very early age. \nAnd finally, they could also play with friends in school. In formal education, schools teach interaction with friends to students. Children can learn methods to play with friends in a school. They can learn mathemathics but also interaction with friends in a school.  Teachers do not teach only mathematics. They also think that the relationship with friends or teachers is also important to childrens. So, they teach ethics and exercise to children in school. In my experience, I didn\u2019t get stress about going to a school. It was also funny things for me. School is the place where students can learn many things, and play with friends.\nFor these three reasons, I think children should go school at a very early age, and they have to learn many things in their formal education.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 8.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified because while the essay presents three reasons for early formal education, the arguments lack depth and supporting evidence, such as the vague mention of 'marvelous things' without specific examples of what those might be.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 reflects the essay's unclear structure, as the transition between ideas is weak, evidenced by the abrupt shift from discussing learning opportunities to personal experience without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'they can accept more easily' and 'it was also funny things for me,' which detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the essay."}]}

However, I disagree with the statement and there are several reasons for this. So now I explain the reasons why I think like this.\n\nFirst, attendance can show conscientiousness. The purposes of universities are not only helping the students learn new knowledge but also giving the right direction and conscientiousness is one of the most important elements for success. So universities need to enhance conscientiousness of students and attendance is the good way to do it. Although some people might think that successful people just have  good intelligence, it is not true. Most successful people who I know are hard-workers. For example, Elon Musk who is CEO of Tesla has worked over 100 hours per week.\n\nSecond, attending lectures is also good for the growth of the study. They can meet many professors through participating classes and professors are very good expertise for their study. So they can give not only their knowledge for study but also tips for research. If there are not any rules for attendance, many students will be lazy and lose their chances for the growth of the research.\n\nTo sum up, university lectures can advance conscientiousness and students are able to improve their skills for study through the lectures. Therefore,  I strongly argue that students should attend classes. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay states that 'attendance can show conscientiousness' but does not provide substantial evidence or examples beyond a single reference to Elon Musk's work ethic.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is warranted because the essay presents ideas in a somewhat logical order, but the transition between points is weak, particularly in the phrase 'So now I explain the reasons why I think like this' which disrupts the flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is justified due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'the good way to do it' which should be 'a good way to do it', indicating a need for more precise language."}]}

I think that's because some people, who agree with it think it ,attending the class is right and another group think it is duty. So I will talk about it more with my opinion.\n\n I think university student should attend to class.  It means that ,as I mention in above, I'm a person who believe attending the class is student's duty. There are two reasons which support my thinking. First, each university has special identity and student should follow it. For example, Kaist has Kaist identity in biology, computer science and so on. So if someone want to be a Kaist biology student, she or he should also have Kaist identity. And for this, atrending the class is not optional but essential. And another reason is that, exam is not only way to test student, but attending is also. Mainly test is regarded to the only way for testing the student. But it is not true. Because \"getting a good score in test\" and \"following and taking the course well\" are not same. Purpose of all course in university is the second one. And for that, attendance check is needed.\n\n University student must have freedom and right. But also they have duty for the right university student. For that, Because the taking the identity of university and following the course well are duty, I believe that student should attend to class.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 2.5/5\nLanguage: 2.5/5\nOverall Score: 8.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear stance on the importance of attending classes, but it lacks depth and clarity, exemplified by the vague statement, 'each university has special identity and student should follow it,' which does not effectively explain the concept of university identity or its significance.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 2.5 reflects the essay's weak structure, as the ideas are not clearly separated into coherent paragraphs, demonstrated by the abrupt transition from discussing university identity to the importance of attendance without clear connections or topic sentences.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 2.5 is warranted due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in 'I'm a person who believe attending the class is student's duty,' which contains subject-verb agreement issues and unclear expression."}]}

Many people think that attending classes should be optional but In my opinion, attending classes is an essential part of the university life. In this essay, I am going to explain why going to classes should be required for all students. \n\nFirst, going to classes can encourage self-learning. Many people think that going to classes can decrease one's ability to practice self-learning but according to my experience as a university student, I found out the more I attend classes, the more I get better at self-learning because the moment I go to class, I fully prepare myself to pay a good attention to the lecture and take notes so when I return back home, I can use my notes as a reference that helps me to understand the class much better.\n\nSecond, attending classes can strengthen the bonding between professors and students. Could you imagine a successful class without students? No because students help the professor to widen the range of the lecture itself, share their answers with the professor, and sometimes, students may share their experiences so the professor can have a clear idea about his students' personalities.\n\nThird and last, going to university is something moral. \"Respect to be respected\" When you attend your professor's class, you express your own respect to him, and this kind of action is important to every student in the university. \n\nFinally, I think going to classes has benefits to students more than damages, and in my opinion, it should be always required to attend classes. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects a lack of depth in the arguments presented, as the claim that attending classes encourages self-learning is supported only by the author's personal experience without empirical evidence or broader examples to strengthen the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 indicates a generally logical flow, but the transition between the second and third points is abrupt and lacks a clear connection, which lessens the overall coherence of the essay.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is justified by several grammatical errors, such as the capitalized 'In' in the introduction and awkward phrasing like 'the more I get better at self-learning,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

And this question about attendance is always hot topic for university students and professors, while it is still not concluded. For this question, I think it is professor's selection to make attendance score important or not.\n\n  Actually, there are some of students can get enough information by some lecture notes professors provided, or just studying themselves with books for a test. It is more likely for low level classes, which is about simple information's transmission. There are higher level classes that students can not get enough good grade when they do not attend to the class, even if that class do not have attendance score. And it is more likely for high level classes, which the information delivered in class can not be find in internet or books, since it is about recent knowledge or which some unique skills that can't be learned outside is learned in class. And some classes which needs debate between students in class will literally need students to follow syllabus Students who take these course should consider this, and these classes should force students to attend.\n\n  By these, we can divide classes by their types, about possibility to deliver class's unique information or experience to students or not. Then should we divide all classes like this and make their attendance score bigger or smaller by this? My answer is no. Almost all classes are not only for information's delivery, even some of they are, It is enough meaningful to see that professor's view of  sincerity. By looking the senior experts directly, they can get something more than information. Some professor can think attendance is not important and student's own studying is more important. Some of them can think attendance is important. Professor's view or attendance can be also find in test problems. Some tests only asks about information in books, but others contain problems that can't be solved when students did not pay attention to professor. And, it is student's choice to take specific professor's class or not, and they also can consider professor's view about attendance.\n\n  To conclude in one sentence, there are various classes, various professors and various students. Professor who is evaluator can select attendance needed or not. and Students can select professors. Free interaction between students and professors will eventually find good conclusion about attendance.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified as the essay presents a relevant argument regarding attendance policies, but it lacks depth and specific examples to support its claims, such as the vague reference to 'higher level classes' without detailing specific courses or contexts.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is warranted because while the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion, the flow of ideas is often disjointed, as seen in the abrupt transitions between discussing types of classes and the professor's perspective on attendance.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 reflects the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'some of students can get enough information' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Since attendance is mandatory to take a course well. However, in my opinion, attendance in university has to be optional for students. There are some reasons why I think that opinion.\n\n First of all, university students are adults, thus they can decide their own behaviors. In high school, students may not decide correct behavior since they are not adults. Thus, they have to be checked the attendance to learn more in classes. However, university students should be responsible for what they do. They will choose their own lives, then they will know what they have to do. Actually, the professor from EE201 class did not check the attendance of students and he said this reason why he did not check.\n\n Second, forcing the attendance will make lower efficiency for studying. University students are so busy with lots of homework, preparing the career and club activities. Thus, they must live efficient lives. If students have homework that its dead line is too close, they will do their homework even in classes. It is very inefficient because they cannot concentrate on both of their homework and the class. \n\n In conclusion, going to classes should be optional for students for two reasons. First, they can decide their own lives. Second, forcing the attendance will be inefficient.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects the lack of depth in the argument, as the essay states that 'university students should be responsible for what they do' without providing strong supporting evidence or examples to substantiate this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct introductory and concluding paragraphs, although the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly when shifting from the first to the second reason.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 indicates some effective communication, yet it is undermined by grammatical issues, such as the phrase 'they have to be checked the attendance,' which demonstrates a lack of fluency and clarity in expression."}]}

Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nAn attendance is the topic that always is talked among university students. Some students say the attendance should be checked in class, and other some say the attendance is unnecessary for university classes. Both of them have rational reason for their claims, and I also agree and understand with both of them. However, I'm agreeing with the attendance is not mandatory a little bit more.\n\n First of all, an attendance check doesn't consider any environment of all students. Unlike high schools and prior schools, there is a possibility that students live where is a far from the university. This means, some students have to spend more time to come school. For specific example, I'm living in Daejeon, but not in dormitory in KAIST. Before COVID-19 pandemic, going to the class took about 30 minutes, and it was hard to attend a class in a time. In addition, COVID-19's untact situation also made a new problem. Students who couldn't enter Korea and live in their country in different time zone, the attendance check is huge problem. Actually I met a student who have to wake up in 5AM to attend a class.\n\n Next, the attendance check requires few minutes during the class. During 4 years in KAIST, I experienced some classes' attendance check consume a lot of times, and it leads poor quality of lecture or late in next class. Though this Advanced English Writing class only have about 20 students, but some major classes have more than 200 people in class. In this situation, being optional of attendance must be helpful for both lecturers and students.\n\n Finally, attending class can be substituted with other methods something like assignments. One of objectives of checking attendance is to encourage students to participate to class and make them study without miss, but these can be checked by other methods. Debating is good option to make students participate, and homework can be also great choice to encourage students study. Thus, there is no reason to check attendance because its objectives can be achieved in other methods.\n\n With 3 reasons I wrote, I think optional attendance have some advantages than mandatory attendance. The most important reason I think is that all of student must be considered, and schools have to do their best to accomplish equality of students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's reasonable arguments against mandatory attendance, such as the consideration of students' diverse living situations, but it lacks depth and specificity in some areas, exemplified by the vague reference to 'rational reason for their claims' without elaborating on those reasons.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, which includes a logical flow from introduction to conclusion, although it could be improved by better transitions between ideas, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing attendance checks to alternative methods of participation.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is supported by generally clear and effective communication, but is undermined by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'an attendance is the topic that always is talked among university students,' which detracts from the overall clarity of the essay."}]}

The reasons are as follows: \n\nFirst, I think a good attendance rate basically liked with good sincerity. and it is not strange to evaluate the sincerity to test the student's attitude toward the class. \n\nSecond, attending classes also helps students to a better understanding of the subject. As many students already experienced, understanding the whole major books is very difficult. It is very thick and contains a lot of various content. but in the lecture, professors summarize the whole book so we can learn the important contents first. Therefore, attending a class is basically improves students' understanding of the subject. So, It is not unusual that universities have force students to attend class to improve their understanding. \n\nSome students said that attending classes is not helpful for them to learn new knowledge efficiently. but considering that the purpose of the university is to teach students, we can get this argument is something wrong. \n\nLastly, as I said before, the basic purpose of the university is to help students acquire knowledge. but If students can acquire knowledge without class, I think it means that students do not require a university. Getting good grades by taking the only tests with good scores without attending the classes is basically not match with the purpose of the university, 'teaching' the student. \n\nSo for the above reasons,  I think university students should be required to attend class.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified as the essay presents some valid points, such as the claim that 'attending classes also helps students to a better understanding of the subject,' but it lacks depth and supporting evidence, which weakens the overall argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is appropriate because while the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion, the transitions between ideas could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing attendance to addressing student arguments against it without clear connections.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 reflects the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in the sentence 'a good attendance rate basically liked with good sincerity,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

First, the way of studying is depend on person. There are some people who can study well in the class. And also, some people do better when they study on their own. In the latter case, forcibly participating in the class can be a hindrance. Second, forced participation in the class degrade class quality. People who couldn't concentrate on the class often sleep or use their cell phones. In the liberal arts class I took, the professor was angry with such people. This not only causes the atmosphere of the class to droop, but can also cause the slow progress of the class.

Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nIn KAIST some classes check attendance but others not. Some people are curious about why we are required to attend classes and think this should be optional. Others think we should required to attend classes. \n\nFor me I think students are not to be required to attend classes for the following reasons.\n\n  First of all, there are some classes which are summarized a lot and hard to under stand. For these classes it is better to do it by my own. Therefore even though we are attending class, we should use another huge amount of time to deal with class material. For these kind of classes it is better to not attend class and just read text book by own. So going to class by optional will make students to choose better study way for each classes.\n\n  Second, optional class makes class atmosphere better. If all of the students are required to attend class, there will be many students attending class who are not willing to participate but just because it is required. Some of these students will sitting on the back side and just doing other works or just sleeping. So if going to class is optional, students who are willing to participate class will attending class so atmosphere will be improved. \n\n  Last, making class optional can make university students to better utilizing time. If we are required to attend classes, we should use that time only for that class but if attending class is optional, we can use that time for other purpose and can deal with class material later time. This can make university students to do things flexible. \n\n  If we make class attendance optional, students can better utilize time, not using time for unbenefitial class and making class atmosphere better. For these reasons, I think for university classes, attending class should be optional.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the presence of relevant arguments, such as the idea that optional attendance allows for better individual study methods, but lacks depth and sufficient evidence to convincingly support these points, as seen in the vague reference to 'some classes which are summarized a lot and hard to understand.'\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 indicates a generally clear structure, with a logical progression of ideas; however, the transitions between points are weak, particularly in the phrase 'Second, optional class makes class atmosphere better,' which does not clearly connect to the previous point about individual study methods.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is justified by the presence of several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'not using time for unbenefitial class,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

However, in my opinion, I think it could not be required for students with the following two reasons. First, students could choose their university lives schedule. Next, attending would not be the best solution for a participating course.\n\n     To begin with, there are a lot of activities to do on campus and students could choose depends on their priority. Some could join the stock club, some want to participate in a debating competition. With these activities, they can improve their skills for their social life after graduated. However, if there is no choice to attend the activities because of attendance, they will be the all same students without individuality. For example, I was in an English Speaking course two years ago. At that time schedule, I want to participate in the robot contest for the country scale which all university students come but the professor said if I absent for the course, I would get an F grade. Since there was no chance to choose, I had to give up the contest which could be an interesting portfolio. As a result, in these days, I could not write any specification myself. \n\n     On top of that, enforced attendance could not the solution for developing concentration for the course. Since university students are adults who have their own ideas, they would even resist for the pressure. Also, they could do any other things in the course such as web surfing with laptops, sleeping. In my friend's case, he was in the chemistry course and computer science course. He hated chemistry extremely but he had to take the course for graduation. On the other hand, he was into programming so he studied computer science out of the course time. Chemistry course's attendace was mandatory while computer science course was not. He was trying to not enjoy the chemistry course and got not a good grades. However, he got A grade for the computer science course. \n\n     To sum up, required attendance does not make all good results for the freedom for students activities. Moreover, it could not be the best solution for improving students' participation. In this regard, I think the optional class attend is better than forced to attend classes.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified because the essay presents a clear opinion against mandatory attendance, but it lacks depth and specific examples to fully support the argument, as seen in the vague reference to improving 'skills for their social life' without detailed explanation.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct paragraphs for each point; however, the transitions between ideas could be smoother, such as the abrupt shift from discussing extracurricular activities to the example of the friend's experience in chemistry.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects generally good command of English, but it includes several grammatical errors, such as 'could choose depends on their priority,' which detracts from clarity and precision in the argument."}]}

Some people says there are other ways to interact to professor like e-mail even if you are not attend the class, But since you should question to professor by e-mail or other materials and this would take much time. And for some cases, If there exist some points you can\u2019t understand then you can\u2019t proceed to next topic and this would be waste of time\n\n Finally, You can interact with other students. You can share question or opinions of other students since class would be interactive. Question of classmates is especailly useful because they have similar understanding level about the same topic so you would have more possibility to wonder about the same thing. This would help your study. \n\n In summary, attending class is much better since you can interact with professor and other students and also you can take better lecture.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a reasonable argument but is weakened by a lack of depth in examples; for instance, the point about missing intensive information from the professor lacks specific examples of how this information has benefitted students in the past.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is warranted as the essay presents ideas in a somewhat logical order, but the transitions between points are weak, particularly between the second and third reasons where the shift feels abrupt and lacks clear connective phrasing.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is justified due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'intenisve information and useful knowledges,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

However some professors allow students to attend freely. I think there are lots of advantage for taking attendance freely.\n\n First of all, student should study more efficiently. There might be no time constraints for students. Without time constraints, students can spend their time more freely. They can study lecture whenever they want, and as much as they want. If the student knows some part of lecture already, they can skip that part and invest more time in other lectures. It will bw more efficient if students participate in class when they think they have difficulty.\n\n Second, students can study in a way that suits for them. Sometimes, professor's teaching stlye may not suit for students. In that case, I think  self-study is more helpful to study. When I was freshman, I attend 'Theoretical linear algebra' lecture. The teaching style of professor was not suit for me, so I couldn't follow the class. So I study my self and I was able to get a good grade. At that time I thought attending the class was a waste of time.\n\n For these reasons, going to classes should be optional for students. Students can use their time more efficiently. Also, they can study in a way that suits for them. If student study on their own, they might be get a better result.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the essay's argument for optional attendance, but it lacks depth as it only presents two main points without sufficient elaboration, such as the generalization that students can study more efficiently without addressing potential downsides or counterarguments.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is warranted because while the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, the transition between ideas is weak, particularly in the second paragraph, where the shift from discussing self-study to personal experience feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is justified by the use of clear and varied vocabulary, but it is diminished by several grammatical errors, such as 'bw' instead of 'be' and 'suit' instead of 'suitable,' which detract from the overall clarity of the essay."}]}

Also, there are students who think attendance is meaningless. I think university students should be required to attend class. There are three reasons.\n\n First of all, students pay tuition fee, and it is quite expensive. Much of tuition fee is for listening to class of professor. However if students do not attend the class, they are paying for nothing. Not attending class is throw the money on the floor. \n\n Secondly, Attending class is helpful to students studying. Becauase the contents of major textbook is hard and very large in quantity, it is hard to study everything alone. With professors help, students are able to know the points of the class and it will reduce the time they study.  Also, It is possible to ask questions to professor directly. It will help the students improve their knowledge. \n\n Lastly, attending class is the way to interact with professor. If there is no one attending class, the professor would be lonely and lose motivation to make a better class. And it can be lead to downgrade the quality of class. Attending class and interacting with professor is good for improve class quality, and it also helps share bright energy among students and professors. \n\n To sum up, Attending class has many brighter side than not attending class, and it has to be required.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 is justified as the essay presents relevant arguments for attendance, such as the financial investment in tuition, but lacks depth and clarity, as seen in the vague statement 'Not attending class is throw the money on the floor.'\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is appropriate because while the essay has a clear structure with an introduction and conclusion, the transitions between points are weak, exemplified by the abrupt shift from discussing tuition costs to studying assistance without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 reflects the presence of multiple grammatical issues, such as 'Becauase' which should be 'Because' and awkward phrases like 'it can be lead to downgrade the quality of class,' which hinder overall readability and clarity."}]}

Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nToday many university students think that they do not have to attend classes since they can study their own and some classes are not helpful for them to understand the course. However, I agree with the opinion that university students should be required to attend classes because there are many benefits attending classes.\n\nFirst of all, attending classes help students to live more diligent. When students have to go to classes, they can have a routine on their lives. For example, they should wake up at 8 am and go to school, take lectures and go back to home. This routine can make students move and help them stay less lazy. School is not the place which only teaches students information, it should lead them to live good lives. So requiring them to attend classes is needed.\n\nAnd attending classes can give students positive energy to study. When people gather in a class and study together, they see others study hard and this can motivate students to study. Moreover, when many people attend classes, it is more easier to understand lectures and think deeply of the content they are learning by listening to other student's opinion and questions. On the other hand, if only few people attend the class, this positive effect will not appear and passion of students to study may decline. So, to make synergy of students, it is better to require students to attend classes.\n\nTo sum up, to make students more diligent and give them energy to study, students should be required to attend classes. These are some positive effects that people cannot have when they are not required attend classes.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay effectively argues that attending classes benefits students, particularly through the example of establishing a routine, but it lacks depth in exploring alternative viewpoints or the potential drawbacks of mandatory attendance.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay presents a clear structure with distinct points made in separate paragraphs, but the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly in linking how motivation leads to diligence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the writer's ability to communicate their ideas clearly, yet it includes grammatical errors such as 'more easier' and awkward phrases like 'to live good lives,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Sometimes, the reason why he do not comes to class is just because he wanted more sleep. \nSome of students may agree with his points, however I believe students should attend class. It is because of below three reasons. First, it helps to learn more for oneself. Also, it is way to guarantee the quality of class for other students.\nFurthermore, it helps to evaluate students' score more fairly. \n\nFirst, students can learn more when they attend the class. In university, education is the most important priority value.\nWhen students comes to class, they can interact with other students. Sharing how their perspective is different about one topic. It helps students to \nget broad and flexible point of view. Also students can interact with advisor. Active communication in classroom with advisor, make advisor to know\nhow students understood the concept of class. Advisor can adjust the difficulty of contents in realtime and provide better quality of class. \nThus, students get more qualified class and learn more, if they attend to class. \n\nSecond, other students coming class would get disadvantage. If attendance is just an option in class, lots of students would chose not to come class. Class contents is not \nonly consist of just advisor's lecture, but also questions and interactions of students. Professors and other students would not get enough \ninteractions from each other. Thus, quality of class would be decreased, if attendance is not mandatory. Some said that attendance is optional, because students have right to choose. \nHowever, it can not be validate, if few student's free choice makes disadvantage to others. \n\nFinally, attendance is fair evaluation criteria. Students get score about class for their semester. Usually, attendance is important criteria to estimate students' effort on class. \nAttendance can be interpreted as minimum effort and care about the class. If one students did their best on class, but get bad grade on test, attendance score can be \nbuffer for them. Because of this, grade could be total evaluation of students' participation, not only just how they get good score in test. Also it is easy to convert in number, so it is\nclear and fair in comparison with each other. \n\nIn summary, I believe that students should be required to attend to class, because of three reasons. Students can learn better, when they attend to class. Also if then, other students \ncan also get better quality of education. Furthermore, attendance helps to evaluate students in more accurate and fair aspects. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a moderate level of argumentation, as the essay presents three reasons for class attendance; however, the reasoning lacks depth, such as when it states, 'it helps to learn more for oneself,' without providing specific examples or evidence to support this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 indicates a reasonable structure, but the transitions between ideas could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing the benefits of attendance to how it affects the class quality without adequate linking phrases.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is justified by the presence of several grammatical errors, such as 'One of my friend always get bad score in attendance,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nThere is a controversy whether university students should be required to attend classes or not. Some people prefer to attend classes up to their mind. Because the control of the attendances can be an intrusion of student's privacy. However, my contention is that the university students should attend classes based two reasons.\n\n First, students have a tendency of having poor control themselves. Students are interested in lots of interesting things except class; computer game, time with their friends and family etc. Especially, the university students can enjoy more unlimited freedom include alcohol. Due to this pleasure, they often fall into temptation. When these feelings get excessive, they can enjoy their spare time even during the classes. Eventually, if these situations are repeated, they will not achieve the goals of the classes they , which makes them deteriorate. To prevent this, participation in class should be made mandatory. Regulating the attendance should help their poor self-control.\n\n Second, the class includes the difficult things to understand without the explanation. Students who are accustomed to study alone don't want to attend the class because they think studying alone is better than studying through the class. However, the class, especially in the university, contains broad and a variety of contents which can't get alone. Also, the university professor have had a lot of experience, and they can give lots of advice based on their dynamic life related to the class contents. Let me bring up my personal story. In last year, I asked the professor for counseling in class, and he gave me appropriate advice, which is beneficial time to me.\n\n In conclusion, my assertion is that university students should be required to attend classes. This is because the students have low self-control, and because the class in university is difficult to understand alone.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects the author's ability to present two main reasons for requiring attendance, but the argument lacks depth and clarity, as seen in the vague phrasing 'they can enjoy their spare time even during the classes,' which undermines the strength of the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the logical flow of ideas into distinct paragraphs, yet the transition between points is weak, particularly in the transition from the first to the second reason, where the connection is not clearly articulated.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay, such as 'the class, especially in the university, contains broad and a variety of contents which can't get alone,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

First, students can communicate with professor or TA directly. When we studied the subject such as circuit physics, dynamics and solid mechanics, we can not understand all materials in the book. However, If we go to the classes, we can ask questions to professor more easier than e-mail or message. Therefore, we can absorb the full materials in the book and increase our skills for solving problems. In my case, I am always attend classes for asking questions that I have not realized well, and it is very helpful for achieve good grades. Second, students can cooperate with students who attend same classes. I think that the cooperation is the most efficient way to study the subject. When we studied together, we can have more chance to experience various thought about the problem and interact with each other. This process will improve the students creativity and knowledge. For example, KAIST open the edu 4.0 course to improve the students creativity. Finally, students can live a consistent life style. If we do not have enforcement to attend classes, students will be lazy and ruin their life style. They will awake up for all night, playing the game or drinking will break down not only their life styles but health. It can also lower the achievement of course.

There are lots of debates in this topic, but I believe that attendance is not necessary and should be optional because of these reasons: \n\n First, attendance do not fully reflect student's academic accomplishment. In other words, it does not mean that attending every class directly leads students to achieve their academic goal. In the class, some students cannot match with the professor's class style. In my experience, when I was in the freshman physics class, I must participate in the every class. However, I always bothered by the professor's question; I usually like to ask the professor what I want, but not like accepting someone's question that I do not want to know. To improve my physic skill, I stopped to attend the physic class and studied physic from the Internet. Even though I got the poor score in the class, but I can say that I am very good at physics. Therefore, attendance check may not directly connect to student's academic accomplishment.\n\n Second, it is important for students to study something themselves, which means that attending every class cannot improve student's real academic skill. I believe that Korean high school class is effective to give knowledge for students but not to give creative thinking, one of the important goal for university professor that they have to give for students. However, if students should attend to the every class, it cannot reflect the \n\n Third, free university life\n\n In conclusion,\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 8.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 is justified because the essay lacks a coherent and fully developed argument, as evidenced by the incomplete third point, 'Third, free university life,' which does not provide any supporting details or explanations.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 is supported by the presence of a clear structure with an introduction and two developed points, but it suffers from abrupt transitions and an incomplete conclusion that detracts from the overall flow of the essay.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'attendance do not fully reflect student's academic accomplishment,' which undermines the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

There are two reasons for this.\nFirst, a communication between the professor and the students is important. One objective of the university class is a discussion between them, not only a knowledge flow. The discussion has a important role in the class because it can generate more knowledge. Also, the announcements could be done during the class. If the attendance is not mendatory, there could be a weak connection between the professor and the students.\nNext, the attendance is a basic respect for the course. In the university, students choose what courses they going to take and make their timetables. Therefore, I think the attendance can show the willing to taking course. Also, it can show the respect to the professor who prepares the classes.\nTo sum up, I agree with that university students should be required to atted classes because of the communication and showing respect.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 8.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5/5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay presents only two reasons for why attendance should be mandatory, with the second reason being somewhat vague, stating that attendance shows 'willing to taking course' without further elaboration.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0/5 is justified by the essay's clear structure, but it suffers from awkward phrasing and transitions, particularly in the phrase 'a communication between the professor and the students is important,' which could be more smoothly integrated into the overall flow of the argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0/5 indicates issues with grammar and word choice, exemplified by errors such as 'a important role' instead of 'an important role' and 'attend' misspelled as 'atted,' which detracts from the overall clarity of the essay."}]}

Of course there are benefits for attending class,  however, it is not necessary. I want to suggest some reasons.\n\n First, almost every information is in the textbook and it is sufficient to read and solve exercises. In many classes are consists of summaries for the book. I agree that some professors give intuition for difficult concept or help students to understand complicated theories which is hard to study alone. However, some just read textbooks in the class or the delivery is too bad to listen during one and a half hour. In other case, it is possible that the lecture is nice but the style of lecture is not fit for student. Considering these possibilities, it is helpful for students to attend class optionally.\n\n Second, students have responsibilities for all disadvantages occur from not attending class. Therefore, if someone who know the advantages for attending and and agree with them, then that one will take class. If someone finds that there is more valuable task that class, then absent and take responsibility for one's behavior.\n\n For these two reasons, I believe that attending class is not necessary.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects the essay's lack of depth, as the author mentions that 'almost every information is in the textbook' without providing sufficient evidence or examples to support the argument that attending classes is unnecessary.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the essay's clear structure, as it presents distinct reasons in separate paragraphs, but it suffers from awkward transitions, such as the phrase 'In other case,' which disrupts the flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted due to several grammatical errors, including the incorrect phrase 'almost every information' and the repetitive use of 'and' in 'someone who know the advantages for attending and and agree with them,' which detracts from the overall clarity of the writing."}]}

Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\n As university students, we attend many classes about several majors and we can get many experiences and knowledge by experiment, lab sessions and so on. However, most university classes have attendance criteria and we get some penalty for grade when we miss or late for classes. Some people say that university students should be required to attend classes, but others say that attending class should be optional. In my opinion, attending class should be optional and there are several reasons supporting my opinion.\n\n First of all, university students are all grown-ups, so they have responsibility for their behavior. In case of elementary school, middle school or high school students, they do not have enough responsibility, so forcing them to attending classes is necessary. However, since university students have enough age to have responsibility for their behavior, professor should not force them to attend class. Missing classes is the own fault of student, and we cannot say anything about it because university students have enough ability responsible for that. Attending classes for university student should be optional and professor should not force students to attend classes.\n\n Next, we can cover the contents of missed classes by self studying with textbooks or searching with websites that can help learning new materials. If we missed the classes, we could cover the contents by self studying with well-written textbooks or many journals. In addition, nowadays, the internet networks are extremely developed, so there are many websites, such as \"Chegg\", that can help us to learn many university-based materials. Self studying might be better for students to understand the study materials, because self studying can lead students to concentrate more.\n\n To sum up, the attendance criteria for university classes should be removed. I think that the most important thing for university classes is understanding of the contents, not the attendance. Although we did not attend to classes, we can cover them with self studying and university students have responsibility for that.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as seen in the claim that university students can cover missed classes through self-study without adequately addressing potential challenges or the benefits of in-person learning.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with a logical progression of ideas from the introduction to the conclusion, although the transition between points could be smoother to enhance clarity.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is supported by generally clear expression, but is undermined by grammatical errors such as 'the own fault of student,' which detracts from the overall professionalism of the writing."}]}

There are 3 reasons for my opinion. \n\nFirst, when you attend classes, you can interact with professors. I think what we can learn from class is not just knowledges but also interaction with professors and wisdom from professors. I am happy to listen to professor's experience and many lessons. \n\nSecond, we can focus more deeply. In my case, when I study alone, I can't focus on for long time. I often use my smartphone. However, when I took classes, I just listened to professors and I could learn fast and efficiently.\n\nLast, communication with friends is very important. Nowadays, COVID-19 is becoming more and more serious issues. Before that event, we can go to school, join a club and meet many friends. In college, we can highly develop our communcation skills through many clubs or festivals etc,,,,,,,,. However, now we could not meet our friends offline. Attending class is one of a way to communicate with many people. \n\nTherefore I think it is really important to force students attend classes. Although some people don't agree with me, I think there are so many advantages when students take classes.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects the essay's limited development of ideas, as the reasoning in the second point lacks depth and specificity, particularly when stating, 'I often use my smartphone' without elaborating on how this impacts learning.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by the essay's clear structure with an introduction and three distinct points, but it suffers from a lack of smooth transitions between ideas, such as abruptly shifting from discussing professors to focusing on personal study habits.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to the use of some effective phrases, like 'wisdom from professors,' but the essay also contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'one of a way to communicate,' which detracts from its overall clarity."}]}

Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nThere are some classes select to do not check the attendance in the university. However, as many classes select, I think checking attendance for making students attend is very important. There are two reasons why university students should be required to attend classes. \n\n  First, if students don't attend the class, it is hard to follow the whole class metarials. Because university classes teach very high-level knowledge, it is hard to take all knowledge about the class on their own studying. In my case, I usually take all classes and focus to understand everything in class. One day, I couldn't attend because I sicked. Although I absent only one day, I couldn't understand the whole class after that day. Thus I have to watch the recorded lecture from that day when I absent again to understand. If I attend every day, I wouldn't have that problem. In fact, attending the class is very important for the student to improve their knowledge. \n\n  Second, attend to class is important to both the professor and the students for the view of class progress. The majority of lecturers have a format of the lecture that the professor gives information to students. As every student is not the same, it is very important to check the level of students and modify class progress to make students follow the teaching. Professor watches the signals from the students as gestures, nodding, focusing, and answering questions to know how much students are following his lecture. Then they can explain again if most students are not understanding or can skip some easy part that almost all students understand well. However, if going to class become optional for the student, many students will not attend class and the professor can't know how many students are following. For the professor, to modulate the progress, for students, get a very high-quality lecture, the attending to the lecture of students is very important.\n\n  As students have to follow the whole lecture materials and to get a high-quality lecture from the professor by modulating the progress, attending is necessary. Thus university students should be required to attend classes.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents two clear reasons for the importance of attendance, but it lacks depth in examples and analysis, such as when the author states, 'In fact, attending the class is very important for the student to improve their knowledge,' which could be elaborated further.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 reflects that while the essay has a logical structure, it suffers from unclear transitions and some awkward phrasing, as seen in the sentence 'However, as many classes select, I think checking attendance for making students attend is very important,' which complicates the initial thesis.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate since the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and grammar, but it contains noticeable errors such as 'sicked' instead of 'sick' and 'absent' instead of 'absented,' which detracts from the overall clarity."}]}

I think students should attend classes. \n\n At first, students should communicate with the professor. There can be some students who can get a good score on the exam without listening to the class, but the test is not everything in the class. Professor can say something that doesn't relate to a test but is helpful for students. Also, in the class, we can learn how to listen to the other's talking carefully, keeping time, and many other things. \n\n Secondly, we need some reward for faithful students. As I argued in the first reason, a good score is not everything. University should teach some social skills and let the students build good characters. If the attendance becomes optional, it is hard for students to learn faithfulness. \n\n Lastly, a university is a school, not a testing institution. Students go to university to learn something. If they already know everything, they don't have to come to the university and the class. Someone can claim like this: \"If students don't attend the class, they can learn nothing. So, it is their responsibility. The university should not force to attend.\" However, university has a responsibility to lead all students to learn the class. Attendance is the smallest policy for it.\n\n I think attendance should not be optional because of these three reasons. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 is justified as the essay presents three relevant reasons for why students should attend classes, but lacks depth and specific examples to support these claims, such as not expanding on how social skills are developed in class beyond simply stating it.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 reflects the essay's somewhat unclear structure, as the transition between ideas is not smooth, particularly when shifting from discussing communication with professors to the importance of rewards for faithful students without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is appropriate due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'Professor can say something' instead of 'Professors can say things,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\n When I look around my friends, quite a few people are annoying to attend class. They wonder about why we should attend the all class and participation must be graded as the score. The main reason about the argument, if we know about the contents about lectures, we don't have to attend the class unconditionally to take a class. Of course, some professors leave student's attendance to their autonomy. Except these examples, in my point, I can't agree with optional attend with lecture. Let's see about several reasons.\n\n First of all, the purpose of the lecture is not only to convey knowledge. No matter how much student knows about the contents of the class, he or she is obliged to hear what the professor wants to deliver through the lecture. If the purpose is to inform the professor's view based on the contents of the class and recent research trends, I think it is natural for schools to make it mandatory to listen to class. Also, it is as important as understanding the contents of the class in general.\n\n Next, the participation of students is helpful for the lecture. If course let the optional attendance, of course there will be friends who want to take classes, but the number of students attending the class will decrease. This can make it difficult for professors to orient their class in proper way. That's because they can not examine whether students understand the content in general or not, is there any confusing contents. Therefore, mandatory attendance is required to know the overall progress of the lecture.\n\n Like the above reasons, university students should be required to attend class. I also argue that although there is burden on attendance it is because I understand that mandatory attendance helps to improve the quality of classes and what to learn through lectures. Thus, I think it is necessary to force attendance as it is now.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for mandatory attendance, but it lacks depth in its reasoning, as seen in the statement 'the purpose of the lecture is not only to convey knowledge,' which is not sufficiently elaborated upon to strengthen the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 reflects an adequate structure, yet the flow of ideas is hindered by awkward transitions, as evidenced by the abrupt shift from discussing the purpose of lectures to the impact of attendance on student participation without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in the phrase 'the all class and participation must be graded as the score,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

It's because of the student's right to choose their own way. If students feel that they learn a lot in the class, then they will go. On the other hand, if students don't think that the class they take is useful, then they won't attend. However, they should notice that the person who is responsible for that result of his or her choice is the student himself or herself. For example, during the class, the professor can give hints to students about the exam. In those cases, students who were absent should know that their disadvantages are the result of their absence. Now, let's think about another case. If students decide to attend the class, they should try to participate in the class as much as possible. Participating in the class is the responsibility of their choices. Giving students the chance to choose whether they will attend or not will be meaningful in education. In society, people should choose one of the multiple choices and have the responsibility for it. In the university, students can learn that kind of thing. To sum up, as university students have the right to choose, the attendance in the classes is optional, but they should realize that they have responsibilities for those choices.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 2.5/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 8.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 2.5 reflects a lack of depth in the argument, as the essay primarily reiterates the idea of student choice without providing substantial evidence or examples beyond the mention of attending class for hints about the exam.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.0 indicates a moderate structure, but the essay lacks clear transitions between ideas, particularly between the discussion of class attendance and the responsibilities that come with it, which could confuse the reader.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.0 is warranted because while the essay communicates its points adequately, it contains awkward phrasing such as 'the person who is responsible for that result of his or her choice is the student himself or herself,' which detracts from clarity and fluency."}]}

Every student has their own learning rithm and attendance policy might break down this.

By that situation, I think people can't study when they have too much free. So, I think the university students should be required to attend classes. Attendance can improve student's participation and improvement. There are some reasons for my argument.\n\nFirst, attendance can make attitude about study. Making life patterns on own life is very important things for their improvement. Because finding study time that they focus on dramatically improve the quality of thinking. But making these patterns is pretty difficult when there are no schedules. I argue the attendance of classes can be good schedule for these patterns. So when student participate attendance, they can make their own rules for study and it connect to efficiency study.\n\nNext, if student listen to the their favorite topic in the class, it isn't good for their knowledge improvement. When they study only for their good thing, there are no development. So student should participate all of the lecture and make many experiment for their major and expand their think.\n\nMaking their own life patterns and Expanding their think through many experiment is important to be good for study and attendance can make these.

This is because they think attending classes is very important and someone believe that university students should be required to attend classes. But I think it should be optional for students.\nFirst of all, university is not a required curriculum such as elementary school and we choose go to university or not. So I think university students have the right to choose to attend. Some student can have more important schedule than classes sometime. For example, a job interview or  important contest that overlaps with the class schedule, students should give up them that might be more important to someone.\nSecond, we can learn lots of things at university beside attending classes. Campus life is pre-social life and it will be valuable experiences for our whole life. I think studying about relationships between friends, seniors and professors can be important than taking all of class. Time at university is limited, then we should spend times with various experience. For example, participating club, competition and festival are also helpful. This is because in the future after graduating university, you will not only study theoretically, but should do various activities such as creation and discussion about content or meetings with others.\nLastly, option to attending classes will be great influence for student. If attending classes should be required, student will feel burdened. Then, student will take a class by duty, and they may not be able to concentrate on the class or lose interest at that subject. Also we can use some lecture note or additional video instead of attending real time class. Then we can use our time efficiently and study the subject we want at any time.\nFor these reason, I think classes of university should be optional for students. Optional class may be great motivation of studying for some student. Also sometimes, a variety of experiences will help us in our career rather than knowing more about the theoretical things by attending classes.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument that university attendance should be optional, but it lacks depth in supporting examples, such as not elaborating on how alternative experiences directly enhance learning outcomes.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is warranted as the essay follows a logical structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but it could improve transitions between ideas, as seen in the abrupt shift between discussing campus life and the burden of mandatory attendance.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate given that while the essay demonstrates a good command of English, it contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'some student can have more important schedule' which detracts from clarity."}]}

Students take their major class, and they have more free time. However, students still have to take classes in time and some courses give penalty for not attending. I think attending class is not necessary, and shouldn't be required or forced.\n\n First, there are many other activities to do in university. Group activities for entertainment, research, or hobby need fixed time, and their schedule should be adjusted. However, if there are many classed to attend, then it will be hard to find time for these activities. Also personal tasks or works might need concentrated and continuous time spend, so it will be good to adjust the studying schedule to have continuous studying time for one course.\n\n Second, disadvantages from not attending class is student's choice.  Professors might give information that can only be learned in class and students might miss if they don't take it. However, the students might think that they can use their time more efficiently by doing other things in class time and want to study the course in other time. Professors won't need to double penalty the student for not attending the class, and not getting information.\n\n Many courses give penalty for not attending class. However, there are many other things to do outside the classroom in university, and not attending class is student's choice and they can choose to go for class or not base on their opinion even with disadvantage.

There are several reasons why I think like that. \n First, they are students. Students are people who learn and study. To learn and study, you have to attend classes. If they do not want to attend classes, they shouldn't have come to universities in the first place. \n Also, there are knowledge and skills needed for people who work in certain industries that can be learned in classes in universities. For instance, if you want to be a physician, you need to learn math and physics. If you want to be a biochemist, you need to learn biology, chemistry and also learn to perform some related experiments. Classes in universities provide you knowledge and help you learn new skills needed for what you're going to do in the future.\n Some people might think that since university students are grown-ups, it is free for them to decide if they want to attend classes or not, and it is not necessary to attend classes to get a job. But students are meant to learn and study in classes, and some jobs need some professional knowledge and skills. If you want this job, you have to earn knowledge and skills required for it through classes. \n Overall, students' duty is to learn and study by attending classes, and classes help you earn knowledge and skills needed for what you will do in the future. Therefore, it is necessary for university students to attend classes.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for why university students should attend classes, yet it lacks depth in examples, such as failing to elaborate on how attending classes directly impacts job readiness beyond the general statement about knowledge and skills.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 reflects a coherent structure, but the essay could benefit from clearer transitions between paragraphs, as evidenced by the abrupt shift from discussing the necessity of classes to addressing opposing viewpoints without a smooth segue.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted due to the consistent use of clear and straightforward language, though it suffers from some repetitive phrasing, such as the overuse of 'knowledge and skills' which detracts from the overall fluency of the writing."}]}

For example, some students can study another weak subject, instead of attending to a certain subject. Or, other students do their personal study in more efficient ways.\n\nSecond, students can improve their ability to take responsibility for their activities. If one student has a problem because of not attending class, then he(or she) will get a low score for that test.

Students can choose what they want to learn, and have responsibility of those decisions. Because of this characteristic, a argument about the student's right of un-attendance university class. Some thinks that classes should be optional for them, but others don't. In this paper, I argue the attending classes in university is required for all students.\n\n  Firstly, university is not the goal of life, in terms of learning. Attending class in high school is required for everyone, since we need a proper theory or prerequisites to understand what we learn in university or to live in society. University is also provide a prerequisites for next step. It is obvious that someone wants to become researcher should study things in university before they see a real professional papers. And others, also, the knowledge and strategies which learned in university will help work in lifetime, like give more solutions of problem related to them.  \n\n  Next, only university can provide a chance to interact with professors, a master of his field. I agree that study alone could be nice strategies. It is true that this method is free from regulated, boring syllabus and can choose interesting one to study. But, in other perspectives, this method have a trap inside. Since a university student is similar to beginners, in contrast with professors, they don't know exactly what is a important part of this subject. And syllabus, which is made by professors can give those information. And, professors also have a huge experiences about own subjects, they can give a best answers for questions about what we learned.   \n\n  In conclusion, university students should be required to attend classes. Since classes in university will provide prerequisites or tools to live life more conveniently, and give a best chance to learn these thing; interacting with professor. So, attending class in university could be a best method to learning things about what students want to learn. Also university should make rules to make attend student in classes\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.0/5\nLanguage: 3.0/5\nOverall Score: 9.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score is a 3.0 because the essay presents a clear argument for attending university classes, but it lacks depth and supporting evidence, such as when the author states, 'it is obvious that someone wants to become researcher should study things in university' without elaborating on what specific knowledge or skills are necessary.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score is a 3.0 because the essay has a basic structure with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, but it suffers from unclear transitions and could benefit from more logical progression, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing prerequisites to the benefits of interacting with professors.\nJustification for Language: The language score is a 3.0 due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'a argument about the student's right of un-attendance university class,' which detracts from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some students like to study alone with their own materials and the others like to study with their friends by making study group. Because the both methods has unique advantages and disadvantages, a debate that finding better approach between them has continued for a long time. In my opinion, although studying alone has some benefits,  studying with their friends is the  better method.\n  First, people can be more motivated since they forming a rival relationship with their colleagues. When they start to make a group, they will think that the other people in same group as not only friends but also rivals. In study group, they are stimulated by friends whenever they feel their ability is worse then the colleagues. To remove this kind of feeling, the students will study harder. As a result, it leads better performance than before.\n  Next, students can improve their degree of knowledge by answering questions of other students in group. A person who tries to demonstrate some ideas should understand them perfectly to explain them. Students who from study group frequently explain some knowledge to their friends. By this kind of activity, they can know the knowlege perfectly.\n  Some people who aruge that learning alone is better try to say the method is more efficient: however, it is not true at all. To understand difficult things, people need more time to think about or someone who can answer for questioin about it. In learning alone situation, students have to spend more time because there are no people to answer for the difficult things. But, in studying with group situation, they can sometimes solve the problems immediately by asking it to group member. Actually, studying with group is more effiecient in this situation.\n   To sum up, studying with group is much better method than studing alone. There are reasons that support this ideas. Students are able to be stimulated by group members, have chances to enhance their knowledge, and study faster by solving curious thing by asking them. For this reasons, I will suggest the people who want to study in more efficient way to study with study group.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 5.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 14.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively presents the argument that studying in groups is superior to studying alone, with examples such as the claim that group members can motivate each other to work harder, demonstrating a strong grasp of the topic.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is well-structured, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that support the main argument, and a concise conclusion, making it easy for the reader to follow the author's line of reasoning.\nJustification for Language: While the language is mostly clear, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'the both methods has unique advantages' and 'students who from study group,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

But now I\u2019m not teenager, I can choose who I want to study with. Studying with my classmates was not bad, but there are some reason I prefer to study alone.\nFirst, I really like friends. Some people think this reason is weird, but it is important to me. When I meet people especially who I care about, it is hard to stop myself talking to them. If I go to study cafe with my friends, probably I will want to know about my friend\u2019s life, what they want, where they went, and who they usually meet. I know myself that I can\u2019t focus on study with my friends.\nSecond reason is noise. People can get stresses easily when they have to study. Furthermore when people get stresses, they care about lots of things around them. Because of my childhood, I get lots of stresses when I have to do study. And when I study, noises around me makes me more stressful. So If some people is near me when I focus on study, It will make me hard to focus on study.\nFinally, for me, home is the most comfortable place to study. Because I can focus deeply when I study at home, I do lots of things in my house, in my room. For this reason, it is hard to bring people to study with me. Many people feel uncomfortable when they go to others\u2019 house. It is good for me and friends that not come my home to study together.\nI talk about my specific reasons that I do not prefer to study with a group of students. I just said with my friend, because I get really lots of stresses when meet people who I don\u2019t know. So I do not think about that case.

Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nI prefer to study with a group of students, rather than study alone. Since, as we are a human, most of other studnets will also prefer study with group. There might be small different point for each students, however most of them have similar habits. In this essay, we will check the reason why most of us prefer the group study in people's basic motivation point of view.\n\nFirst, group study make students to compete. Think about there are two students are in the same room, studying the math for the test in tomorrow. All students wants to get good score at the test. Also, if there are friends who take same course with me, definitly they want to win from each other. That make the motivate to study more harder than before. In these days, there are some argue that students feel too much stress because of the competition. Unfortunatley, somtimes students suicide because of this stress. However, without competition, still we can't get good result from the test. We should able to control this stress not only our-self but also for others. \n\nSecond is about the cooperation. In the previous paragraph, we talked about the competition but the group study also make the cooperation. Cooperation is very easy and simple. For example, if you can't understand about some thesis or the mathmatical equation, your friend who are very good math can teach you. Or if both of you forgot how to solve the problem, you can cooperate to find what is the correct answer. There are very famous sentence from the Indian that \"When you face very hard problem in your life, cooperate with your collegue to solve it\". People are the specices that grwo up when they cooperate.\n\nFianlly, it can make different atmosphere compare to study alone. Most of us have to study long time. It could be boring, sleepy, and tired. Students want to take a rest or nap. They usually more prefer to play the computer game or play the soccer at the field. However, if you study with group, they make you to keep sit down and grab the pencil. Also, the situation which you are studying make other studnets to study. These atmosphere make them to concentrate more and easy to jump in to their book. Someone say that group study can cause bad atmosphere easier than good atmosphere. However, since I have a lot of experience for a various kind of group study, more than 90% of case was good. The key point was myself. So we should try to do our best all the time.\n\nTo summarize, there are three main reasons why group study is more prefered than studing alone. Group study make students competative, the experience how to cooperate with other people, and to feel the atmosphere from their passion. I also want to say there are several benifit for study alone. It can easy to manage the time, you don't need to consider what clothe wear today. But actually, those are not helpful. Most of benifit from study alone is based on time. But the other side, group study has lot of effective benefit to improve your score. In these reasons, I prefer to study with a group of students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's strong exploration of the benefits of group study, particularly in the discussion of competition and cooperation; however, the argument is weakened by the inclusion of an unrelated and extreme example of student suicide, which detracts from the primary focus.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct paragraphs for each reason supporting group study, though the transitions between ideas could be smoother, particularly in the shift from competition to cooperation.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'the motivate to study more harder' and 'the situation which you are studying make other studnets to study,' which hinder clarity and overall readability."}]}

Some students prefer to study alone, others like to study with a group of students. Some people say the study is the way of  standing alone. They think study alone is the best way to study. However, study with a group of students is much efficient than study alone.\n\nPeople say study alone save the time because, we don't have to spend time to others. However, study with a group of students save much more time. When we study, there are the problems that we can't understand. If  we study alone, there is no one to ask the problem.  Solving the problem alone takes a lot of time, but if we study with group of students,  some member might know the answer of the problem. Also, we can share the tips during the studying. Asking the problem each other and sharing the tips are very helpful to save time. \n\nWhen we study with a group of students, some people think it's hard to focus on the study. They think  group study is one of the playing, and it's hard to concentrate. However it is not true. If  the members have a will of study, group study makes positive effects. A study cafe is the good example of it. When we go to a study cafe, everyone study hard. Also, for some people compare  themselves with others. These mood makes us more concentrate and focus to the study. The number of study cafe is still increasing. This shows people already know the positive effects of group study.\n\nStudy with a group is much efficient than study alone.

Someone uses timer, someone uses blocker app which blocks distracting application and Internet sites, and someone move place to study cafe. There are some people who try to help focusing each other by making study group. I don't think this is solely bad idea, however, I prefer studying alone rather than studying with a group of students because of several reason.\n First, it takes too much time to get familiar with whom study with me. It looks easy, however, I have timid personality which makes me frozen when I try to talk to others. For example, when I started group study about English speaking, I couldn't say English sentences fully because I was too frustrated. It didn't get better until I leave the study group.  Even though it is non-verbal studying group, I am nervous because of thought that other students will see me. It keeps me not to do other things rather than studyng, but it also hinders me to focus on studying. \n Second, studying group with friendly people is inefficient. It would be better if group members promised not to do any private acts, however, it is not easy. This gets worse if group members are friends, in order to get rid of the effect of my introvert personality. For example, I usually found myself who spent two and half hours just to eat dinner with other members. If I studied alone, I would spend only a half hour for simple meal. Also, we usually said jokes and tricked each other while studing. It is definitely waste of time. \n Third, studying alone enhances my ability to focus on. Basically, we have a lot of things to focus on in society. Researching, working at company, or designing products are all example that requires focusing. In those cases, you cannot expect any help. You should solve your problem while other people do not care about how you are doing but only care about what you have done.  To prepare all of those works, the ability to focus on with only one's power is required. Studying alone is the best way to enhance your focusing ability since you should do all of the works by your own. \n To sum up, there are not much advantages to study with other students. I have hard time when group members are not familiar and I waste so much time when group members are friends. Also, studying alone has its own benefit that enhances my focusing ability a lot. Other people might have different idea because they have different personalities and experiences compared to me. Anyway, I would choose studying alone by myself, rather than making studying group. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects the essay's ability to convey personal reasons for studying alone, but it lacks depth in exploring counterarguments or alternative perspectives, as evidenced by the limited discussion on the potential benefits of group study.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, where each paragraph presents a distinct reason for studying alone, yet the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly in the second paragraph where the flow from personal experience to broader implications feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate due to the overall clarity of expression, though there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as 'studyng' instead of 'studying' and awkward phrasing like 'enhances my ability to focus on,' which detracts from the overall professionalism of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nStudting alone and group studying are two ways commonly used by students for all kinds of subjects. Both methods has advantages and disadvantages, and every one has his preferance between the two. I personally like group studying more, and I think that it is more affective and less time consuming and help the student to get a better grade. \n\n     First, group studying gives you and your group a wider point of view on the subject. The wider view helps understanding all the subject and getting all the ideas. The group will share their notes, ideas, and questions, and  this sharing will help all the group members to get the most of the knowladge given in the lectures. In my case, my group members always give me important information that I skipped or did not notice while group studying.  On the other hand, for someone who is studying alone, he will have his notes only and will not share his ideas and questions with his classmates, and that might couse him to misunderstand an idea or skip it. \n\n     Second, group studying gets you the motivation you need. Personally, I get motivated to study when I have a group, and when I study alone I get distracted and I waist my time on something other than studying. This motivation would help you to study the subject more, and go throu all the question and ideas.  \n\n     Third, having a group to study with means that you will always have someone to ask when you need help. Your group can answer questions you dont know, can explain an idea you do not get, and save you time trying to do it on your own. Studying alone takes alot of time, and there is a chance that you will miss some part of the subject. \n\n     Fourth, one more benefit of group studying is that you can check your understanding with your group before taking the exam. For example, the group can take a sample exam togather and compare their answer. In this way they can be sure that all the group fully understand the subject and ideas given.  \n\n     Finally, I prefer group studying over studying alone because it gives a wider view on the subject, gets you motivated, group members will help each other, and checking their understanding of the subject before the exam. These benefits can help the students to get better grade, I noticed that I had better grades when I group study for a subject. For these reasons I always recommend student to group study more often, because it can give you a better grade and save you the time you spend studying alone. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 5.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 14.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively discusses the advantages of group studying, such as the sharing of knowledge and motivation, but it could benefit from more specific examples or evidence to strengthen its claims about academic performance.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is well-organized with clear topic sentences and a logical flow of ideas, as seen in the structured presentation of each benefit of group studying in separate paragraphs.\nJustification for Language: While the language is mostly clear, it contains several grammatical errors and typos, such as 'Studting' instead of 'Studying' and 'waist' instead of 'waste', which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Which do you prefer, study alone, or study with a group? Some people like studying alone because there is no restiction. However, I think studying with a group is better than study alone. \n\nAt first, people who think studying alone is better argue that they can schedule study time freely. However, for the person who thinks appointment with the other is more important than appoinment with himself or herself, this may cause bad effect. For that person, he/she will study hard to prepare the group study because he/she thinks the preparing is an appointment with the group members. However, if he/she studies alone, he/she can delay the study time because he/she does not think it is important. Appointment with a group may be forcing him/her to study.Therefore, for the person who thinks he/she have to follow an appointment with the others, studying with a group is more effective way to study.\n\nFurthermore, we can learn more through asking and answering some problems to each other. If you cannot understand some part, you can ask to the other members. If someone know, he/she will explain that part, so you can easily understand it. If there is nobody who knows it, then they will searching to solve the problem. Searching with a group members is more effective than searching it alone, because of the number of searching people. Also, you can learn from the answering the question which is from the other group member. Did you heard that \"we can learn more through teaching to the other\"? To answer clearly, and effectively, you should exactly know about the answer. During the explaination, you can summarize and make clear in your brain. So, it could help you to learn deeply.\n\n\nTo sum up, if you think an appointment with the other is important, then studyging with a group may be forcing you to sotudy.

Also, you may want to study that you want to learn more about even there are no exams. At those times, someone likes to study alone and someone likes to study with friends. Which one do you prefer? I like to study alone and in quite environment. Because this makes me more flexible with my schedule and focus on only contents that I study. However, many people like to study in a group with their friends. They argue that it is more helpful to study together. I am going to write some counterarguments they say and refute them with my own reasons. \n First, people who like to study together say that they can ask questions to each other so it makes them to understand the contents well. However, I think that the environment where they can talk together makes me more distractive. So, eventually, I will not focus on my study well when I am with my friends. Also, if the questions are things that I already know well, that would be just noise for me. When I am alone, I am fully focused on what I am studying and I can ask questions to my teacher or friends later.\n In addition to first, other people say that when they study in a group, it is going to motivate you to study hard. But what if their schedule is so fast or too slow? They are going to have schedule that every people in that study group need to follow. However, if you know too much more than them, or you have no idea what they are talking about, it would be really inefficient and you may be unmotivated even more. When you study on your own, you can adjust your schedule by your self so you don\u2019t need to concern about such problems. You can make your best environment and schedules to study very efficiently. \n To sum up, studying together is distractive because of its envirionment, and because they need to stick to their own schedule, it is inefficient. However, when you study alone, you can make your own plan that is just right for you and not be distracted by anyone. You can be yourself and calm so that you can fully focus on your things to study. Maybe sometimes studying together would be helpful if you find perfect friends to study with. However, for the most of time, I really prefer and stronly recommend you to study by yourself because it would be much more efficient for you. This will help you to save your time at the end. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's strong argument in favor of studying alone, but it is somewhat weakened by the lack of depth in the counterarguments, such as the statement 'However, many people like to study in a group with their friends,' which does not provide specific examples or evidence to support the opposing view.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, which presents an introduction, counterarguments, and a conclusion, although the transition phrases could be improved, as seen in 'In addition to first,' which is awkwardly phrased.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is appropriate due to generally effective use of vocabulary and grammar, although there are noticeable errors such as 'distractive' instead of 'distracting' and 'stronly' instead of 'strongly,' which detract from the overall clarity."}]}

Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nEducation programs in these days usually encourage people to discuss their thinking with others. Some professors in KAIST even tell students to study as a group. However, there are still lots of debate about studying with a group is efficient or not. I personally think that studying together eventually enhance performance in perspective of getting knowledge.\n\nSome might said that studying with a group will cause significant decrease of patience. However, there are lots of researches that studying with friends with same goal make the group to accomplish faster than studying alone. It may decrease patience sometimes, but group with aligned purpose will succeed at the end. Also, there are some opposing argument that studying alone is efficient when time is limited. However, studying is not just activity to prepare for single test. We should study forever to develop myself and become better person. Therefore, thinking study as time-attak task is not right. In addition to these couterarguments to the claim that  studying alone is better, there are several reasons why studying as a group is better.\n\nFirst reason is that studying as a group will eventually make that group to acoomplish goal very concisely. If we study together, we usually have time to test that my knowledge is right. By doing this, we can figure out that we are doing right now. As I said above, study is not time-attack task. We should make castle of knowledge as concrete as possible. Studying with group will help me to get exact knowledge. \n\nSecond reason is that studying as a group will encourage group to overcome some difficult task. If we study some very hard fields, there might be some point that nobody knows how to solve some problem. Then thinking as a group will make me to overcome this. There is word \u201cgroup intelligence\u201d. This means thinking as a group has more diversity and even more concreteness than thinking as individual. In perspective of getting knowledge, group study will help to find unsolved problem. Even you cannot find solution, experience with different point of view will make your life more flexible than before. \n\nAs I wrote, despite of opposing arugments that studying alone is better, there are quite lots of good reasons that we should study as a group. Human is social animal. We can become top predator of Earth, since we are the animals that can communicate the most complex than others. If we study as a group, we will not only learn about that field concisely, but also learn how to solve hard problem with communication. If we go out to society and work, these will me the most valuable experience. I hope every students in KAIST know this things and help each other to become leader of world.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's strong argument for group study, but it is weakened by the lack of specific research references to support claims, as seen in the phrase 'there are lots of researches' without providing concrete examples.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, including distinct reasons for group study, yet it could be improved with smoother transitions between ideas, as evidenced by abrupt shifts like 'First reason is that studying as a group will eventually make that group to accomplish goal very concisely.'\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate due to some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'Some might said' and 'this will me the most valuable experience,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nStudy is one of the most important things to do for all people. However, it is not fun and interesting for anytime despite it is quite important for our life. Therefore, many people suggest various studying type to make more concentration and efficiency. Among them, there are two main types of people either prefer studying alone or together. I think each of them have several persuasive reasons why we have to study alone/together, but I think studying alone is much better. There are three main reasons why I prefer to study alone.\nFirst of all, studying with other people can easily break concentration. Concentration is one of the most important factor for good study efficiency. Some opponent argue that group study also make students to concentrate for their study, but I think it is not. If group members become more friendly, it can easily interrupt concentration for all members in the group. For example, they can go out for eat or just chtter with each others in study time. However, if we study alone, we can completely elimminate these obstacle for study. Then, student can improve their concentration and it will be directly related their grades.\nIn addition, studying alone have better time efficiency too. Students in usual group study have to prepare their materials to share with their group members. Moreover, they need to devide each part of study and need to prepare presentation. Group members also need to set a proper meeting time and they have to move for meeting place.  These process need much more time than studying alone. Time is very important thing for student, but it is a waste of time. If student study alone, he/she can utilize that free time for more study or break. Student don't have to consider nice visualization of their study and move.\nThe last supporting reason is study style. As I mentioned before, there are tons of study styles in the world, so each student have different study type with regard to their characteristic and ability. However, if student study together even they have different proper study style, group study could make bad effect to every students in group. For example, if someone prefer to study with discussion and talk but others just want to share their study materials, they can be a obstacle for each others. On the other hand, if student study alone, student do not need to consider others study style. Also, student can try many other kind of study styles in their own time without other's effects. I think it is more helpful for student to find their study style.\nIn conclusion, I think students can get so many advantages by studying alone. They can make more concentration and save time. Also, student can freely try other changes for study style. Of course, there are more advantages about studying alone, but most important thing for study is motivation. Motivation is much important for student regardless of study style. I hope many students improve their grade with my suggestions.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 5.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively presents a clear argument in favor of studying alone, supported by reasons such as the ability to maintain concentration, as seen in the statement 'studying with other people can easily break concentration,' which strengthens the content score.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is well-organized, with a clear introduction and distinct supporting paragraphs, as shown in the structured presentation of each reason for studying alone, which justifies the high organization score.\nJustification for Language: The language score is lower due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'if group members become more friendly, it can easily interrupt concentration for all members in the group,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Studying is one of unavoidable problems that you can meet in your life. Therefore, we should know how to improve studiyng efficiency. Then, How can we improve our studying efficiency? In this article, I insist that studying with other people can help you. \nFirst, If you study with friends, they are able to explain content that you misunderstand. If you misunderstand something, then it takes many time to notice and modify it. Therefore, we have to prevent it before the situation occurs. Studying with friends will help you. If you share your concept that you understand during studying, your friends can inform you if you are in wrong place. That will save your useless time.\nSecond, If you are in group that is consist with simular level companion with you, then you will want to exceed them. It makes you study with more concentration. If you are in group that has simular level with you, then this group members will become your rival. Good rival inspires you to study more. Because you probably don't want to lose. In result, they will give you more studying efficiency. \nSomeone repute this argument by saying that studying with friends distract our focus. Because we can talk each others during study. Actually, that's not true. That is the case of misusing studying together. If you want to improve study efficiency during study,  you have to seperate time, and classfy each time. For example, you should make focus time, and talking time. In focus time, your group has to talk about topic that you study. However, In talking time, your talking doen't have to be entangled in topic that you study. People has limited concentration power. So, this will help you prevent to distract. \nIn summary, I said that studying with friends will help you get nice study-efficiency. Because, your friends will inform you if you misunderstand something, and they can become a good rival. In addition, I refuted sentence that studying with friends distract you. Many say that we have to study more than previous era. Because many of concepts were made in this era. Good companion will become good teacher, and good rival. They will improve your result that you will make. I hope you to meet good companion that you can study with.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument that studying with friends enhances efficiency, though it could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples or evidence to support this claim, such as specific studies or personal anecdotes.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 reflects a logical structure, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion; however, the essay could benefit from smoother transitions between points, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing misunderstandings to competition among peers.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is warranted due to several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'studying is one of unavoidable problems' instead of 'studying is one of the unavoidable challenges,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

When the exam dates are closer, or there are many assignment, or there are many researches to study, they study. However every people has the unique studying characteristic. One of them is studying alone or with a group of students. Some people prefer to study alone, but some people prefer to study with a group of students. Both characteristics have each advantage and disadvantage, but I prefer to study with a group of students.\n The first reason is that studying with a group of students can let me ask to my friends. If I study alone, when some conetents whtch I don't know is appeared, there are no people who I ask. I can ask to my friends by messengers, but it is not efficient. The communications may not be fast, and if there are some equations, it is hard to express the equations by messengers. Searching on the internet might be helpful to me, but internet shows too many informations. If I search some contents, internet shows every contents related to those. It can help me, but it is hard to find the exact contents which I don't know. It will take a long time. But, if I study with a group of students, I can ask to my friends or discuss about those contents. It may be more efficient than studying alone.\n The second reason is that studying with a group of students can make studying environment. The environment is very important when studying. If the environment is not right to study like PC room, I can't study well. But, if I study with a group of students, it can make the studying environment. Although I can't concentrate on studying, there are my friends around me, so I will try to concentrate again. Also it can motivate my will. However, someone says studying with a group of students can make a bad studying environment. They can talk or play all day long. But, if I just play all day long when I study with a group of students, I will play alone when I study alone. That situation isn't from a group of students.\n To sum up, I prefer to study with a group of students by these reasons. In my experience, I studied well and got a good grade at the exam when I study with a group of students. But, since these are just different to people's characteristics, it is important to find each studying charcterisitc.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay effectively discusses the advantages of studying in a group, such as the ability to ask questions and create a motivating environment, but it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or personal anecdotes to support these claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct paragraphs for each reason, yet it could be improved by enhancing the transitions between ideas to create a more cohesive flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the overall clarity of expression, but is impacted by several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'conetents whtch I don't know is appeared,' which detracts from the overall readability."}]}

There are many types of study. Some prefer to study alone, while others prefer to study with friends. There can be many other types. There's no answer to the way you study, but I prefer to study alone among theme. \n To begin with, let's list the advantages of studying with a group. The biggest advantage is that you can share what you know with your group. If you don't understand something, a friend who know it can be in your group. This interaction whithin the group creats a positive synergy.\n Another advantage is that group study makes studying more fun and interesting. Studying with friends is more fun than studying alone. it can be the motivation for studying.\n But it is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Group studies degrade individual concentration. For example, you may have felt a desire to chat with your friends during a group study. However, if you study alone, there is no interference from others. I recomend you study alone if you are more disturbed by  group studies than the synergy you feel through it.\n Next, the advantage of studying alone is that it is free from schedules. You can study at the time and place you want without caring about others. Let me give you some examples. You can study even in a short period of time, and you can study at home without going out. But, group studies are hard to do. \n In summary, group studies have the advantages of synergy and fun through sharing, and studying alone has the advantages of concentration and schedules.  I prefer to study alone because I like the advantages of studying alone more. However, it can feel differently from person to person. if you understand the advantages and disadvantages of each study type and choose your own way of studying, you will be able to study more efficiently.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.0 reflects a lack of depth in the discussion, as the essay mentions advantages of studying with a group but only provides a single example of 'sharing what you know' without further elaboration on its implications.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is justified by a generally clear structure, but the transition between points is weak, particularly when the essay abruptly shifts from discussing group study to the advantages of studying alone without a smooth segue.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is supported by the use of varied vocabulary, but there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as 'whithin' instead of 'within' and 'recomend' instead of 'recommend,' which detract from the overall clarity."}]}

By communicating with each other and memorizing it with writing, drawing, and teaching to someone led civilization, and it made a human different from other creatures. When we are studying, we can utilize this ability and improve our understanding. However, some might say it is better to study alone because leaving oneself alone can make people concentrate more on their work. Actually, that argument is not correct. There are some reasons why studying with a group of students enhance our quality of study.\n  First of all, opponent of group study always argue that it harms one's concentration. It could be somehow true, unless you are ready to be willing to study. When you have rigid will to succeed today's work, leaving your friends beside you does totally not matter. Even, it could be helpful because your friend can be a audience who watches you studying. By having a watcher, you feel uncomfortable to take relaxed time. You also can be that position to your collegue, and you both are giving a help to each other. How cooperative it is!\n  Additionally, you are not just seeing your friend, but also feeling competitive. Some argue that too much competition can result in destructive outcome. However, positive competition can improve efficiency of our work and give motivation to do better. Getting out of boring circumstance and encounter positive stimulator, exactly your friends, can refresh your mind and \n  Moreover, if you study with your group, you can share your questions and informations with your members. As I already said, communication is the very important ability of humans. By teaching your friends what you know well, you can reorganized the information and stack them more firmly in your brain. Plus, by recieving answers what you don't know well, you can obtain the unknown knowledge so easily. This property of group study is the point many lecturers and instructors are focusing on, which make them try to increase the disscussion part in their classes.\n  To sum up, group study can make people concentrate more on their work, cause positive competition, and communicate each other to get some information easily.

Some students prefer studying with a group of students, while the other students like to study alone. In my case, I prefer to study alone.  These are the reasons why I think like that.\n Before talking about the reasons, let\u2019s talk about the oppose opinion. As you know, if you study alone, it\u2019s hard to ask something to others.  So, according to oppsers, studying without a group can make problems when you face obstacles that you don\u2019t understand yourself. However, there are many ways to solve this problem by studying alone. The Internet is one of it.  By using Google, you can find books, papers, dictionaries and lecture notes about something you don\u2019t know. Also, Youtube can give you lectures related to your obstacles. In addition, there are some sites that you can ask your questions, such as Cheggs. Therefore, the problem that you can't ask something to others is not a problem.\n Now, it\u2019s time to talk about the reasons studying alone is good. Fisrt, you can study whatever you want. When I was second grade in KAIST, I studied with a group of my department\u2019s friends. However, because it was group study, sometimes I had to study something that I wasn\u2019t interested in. On the other hands, when I study alone, I can study anything that I want to know or need to know.  That\u2019s the first reason. \n Next, if you study alone, nobody disturb you when you are studying. However, when you do a group study, many people would disturb you to concentrate on the study. In my case, when I studied with my group, friends try to talk and play with me rather than just study. I think that if you study with your group, you might have problem like this.\n In conclusion, there are two reasons why I prefer to study alone : can study whatever I want, can study without disturbace from my friends. Furthermore, the problem that you can\u2019t ask something to other can be solved by using the Internet. Then, how about studing alone rather than studyng with a group student? It would be a good choice for you!\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents clear reasons for preferring solitary study, such as the ability to study topics of personal interest, but it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or personal anecdotes to enhance the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted because the essay logically presents the argument with a clear structure, but the transition between discussing opposing views and personal preferences could be smoother to enhance overall flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'disturbace' instead of 'disturbance' and 'studing' instead of 'studying', which detract from the overall clarity of the essay."}]}

Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nAll students to need study. There are many ways to study contents from lots of sources such as textbooks, online sources, projects and etc. And some people have a contorversy how to study. Some students prefer to study alone while others prefer to study with a group. I prefer to study alone, there are two main reasons for this; I can absorb context with my own index better, and study alone can make me think more creative.\nMost important reason why I prefer study alone is to absorb context with my own index better. People who prefer study with a group claim that group of students can share idea better, so it will be more effective. However, this can be accomplished only with the condition that students all know about the topic very well, and can share information. In most of the cases, all students are new at the contents, and they need to know better to talk with other students. Studying alone can figure it out. I make my own structure when I study alone. This can make the contents more organized my brain and I helps me to understand the contents better. This can be accomplished only when I study alone, because I need my own time to think about the contents, and organize it to make my own information which can be used in other situations.Thus, I prefer to study alone which makes me to absorb the contents from the sources better.\nMaximizing creativity is another reason to support preferrence to study alone. Some argue that students can study more by checking errors each other. In contrast, this means they can get the answer more easily by it. Thinking more about the topic which can be confused will more helpful at the end. Studying alone can make you more creative by thinking more about the topic. This is because this can make you do anything which is related to the question. I can not the so efficient and be compact to answer it, so it can make it to think beyond the topic which the question is talking. Moreover, this can make me be more creative by connecting more information that I have. For example, when I learn about information theory, I can connect it with circuit theory and artificial intellignece so use information theory in other portions of study, however, when I study with a group, I only can talk about information theory itself to be efficient and find the answer more quickly. Thinking more about the topic makes information to remain more in my brain. Therefore, I can think more creative by studying alone, which is the reason for me to prefer study alone.\nTo sum up, I can absorb the contents better when I study alone, and also can be creative because this can think me more. These are the reasons why I prefer to study alone. Actually, it is the best way to study with your own way of study. Studying alone can be better for some students, and studying with the group can be better with others. It is your own choice how to study.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's clear assertion of the author's preference for studying alone, supported by two main reasons; however, the argument could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how studying alone has personally benefited the author in different scenarios.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, which includes an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, yet it suffers from some awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift in the second paragraph from discussing group study to personal structure without a smooth segue.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and sentence structure, but it is hindered by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, exemplified by sentences like 'study alone can make me think more creative,' which should be 'study alone can make me think more creatively.'"}]}

Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nAlmost every adults prefer their children to study alone. They think studying is remembering some knowledge in textbooks. Also there were many students study in \"study room\" \nwhich is seperated by small desk for one student. However in these days, many students argue that study with group is more efficient than alone. Many students study in cafe or \ngroup study room rather than normal personal study room. Although both sides' arguments are tense, studying with group of students is better choice for today's students. \n\n     First reason for opposing 'group study' is related with old phrase \"many boat worker moves boat to mountain\". It is an old saying that means 'when many people gather, direction \nwould be hesitated'.  Many adults are scarying with students to go for wrong direction in studying. However, I think group study has function that students can fix their direction and \ngive motivation. Students don't make group randomly. Each studying group has their purpose and direction. Also, group study could stimulate each students for studying hard. \nStudying by group has exact direction and also stimulate students study hard. \n\n     Second reason for opposing group study is efficiency. Many adults think studying is just remembering textbooks. In the past years, it was right. However, in these days many \nacademic areas were changed. Through 2010s, many universities and highschools emphasize the 'variety area thinking'.  As world develop in very fast speed, simple memoring \nbecomes useless. Students need to unify many areas and technologies. Along these periodical change, group studying is hot in these days. Many students who are specialist for \neach major or area, can study together and make something new. Group study is needed by pereodic flow of technologies. \n\n     There are still many opinions which study type is better. However, group study would help students have motivation for studying and it's periodic flow of technologies. Studying \ntype is on each students taste. However I suggest students to study with some group members for more enjoyful and efficient studying. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay scores a 4.5 for content because it effectively argues that group study is beneficial, but it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how group study leads to improved outcomes, such as mentioning particular studies or statistics.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 reflects a logical flow of ideas, though the transitions between points are somewhat abrupt, such as the sudden shift from discussing the fears of adults to the benefits of group study without a clear bridge.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate due to frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'Many adults are scarying with students to go for wrong direction in studying', which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Because they can seperate their jobs and help each other. There are more benefits in group rather than alone. In other case, such as studying, to study with a gruop of students is more powerful method. There are two kinds of situations, one is similar level and the other is different level of students. There are some benefits in each situation.\nIf each group member has similar grade, they can cooperate for solving the same task. Another group member who has solved the same problem with yours is better than teacher or smart student. He or she can explain answers in 'your language'. It means the most method you can understand well.\nIf each gruop member has different grade, they can help each other. In other words, one student can be teacher for other students. It sounds like one student sacrify his or her time, but it's not true. In my case, when I was in high school, I helped my friends to understand mathematics and biology. I could find my weak understanding by explaining.\nTo sum up, studying with a group of students is better even if they have similar or different grade.

Studying is requires not only concentration but also various ability like problem soving skill. However, not everone can have this ability. Therefore various studying method have been proposed. Among those methods, Many people discuss about what is helpful when we study alone or group. Some people think that studying alone can help you focus more. However, I think there are more advantage when study with group.\nFirst of all, You can ask your friends what you don't know.  Friends who listen same class with you are the best teachers before competitiors. Each student has different ability so, student has different area of well understanding. Thus, They can fill weakness part of studying each other. According to the curve in obilivision, human can memorize better when they listen same thing  again and again. discussion with friens also make memorizing better.\nNext, It motivates each other. Some student is well trained self directed learing. They find their motivation from themselves. However, most of students study in academy not-self studying at home. They must find something  to motivate  from the outside. The best thing in this case is the friends aroud you. If your friends study hard, you also think that you should study hard too. \nFinally, It can be free from excessive stress during the test period. During the test period, Thing to be stressed come from every where. The best thing in this situation is convestation with friends. As they are in a same situation, they can understand and empathize with each other better than anyone else. The most basic thing in poetry studies is the attitude of listening. If you have an attitude of listening at other's eyes level, they will be share their worries. However, there is no need for such thing between friends. Because they already understand because they are in same situation. Therefore, studying with friends can reduce the stress.\nThis is why I prefer to study as group. It is helpful for our studing, motivation even, It can reduce our stress and make more focus to studying. It will bring more better grade.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects a generally clear argument but is weakened by the lack of specific examples to support the claims, such as the statement 'human can memorize better when they listen same thing again and again' which lacks citation or evidence.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the logical structure of the essay, where the author effectively uses transitions between points, such as starting with 'First of all' and 'Next,' but is slightly hindered by some awkward phrasing that disrupts the flow, like 'the best teachers before competitiors.'\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate due to frequent grammatical errors, such as 'Studying is requires not only concentration' and 'not everone can have this ability,' which detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nAs exam period comes, every place in KAIST such as cafes, librarys are full of students who study hard for exam. I am also the one of them, too. There are numerous types to study. Some students just read and memorize all stuffs, whereas some student write down the contents and share with their friends. There is also different preference  of the number of person study with. Some students prefer to study alone, whereas others prefers to study with a group of students. Personally, I prefer  group study than the study-alone. There are several reasons of the preference: Share the difficulty, be less tired, can concentrated more.\n\n\nWhen we study for the exam, there are a lot of problems or concepts that we cannot understand for our own. If you study alone, maybe you will send E-mail to professor or teaching assistent. However, it tooks a lot of time for replying and hard to read because the answer is on text. If you have friends who study near you, you can just ask them and solve the problem. And when your friends asks you the concepts you already knows, you can also help them. Sometimes you will realize you don't know the concept exactly well. This will be helpful to you to know what you don't know yet and understand the concept perfect.  \n\nThe study for exam is inevitably the fighting against sleep. Most student sleep less than usual for study. If you study alone, there is no person to wake you up. And the circumstance around you might be very quiet, so maybe you feel more sleepy nad tired. When you are with your friends, they can wake you up when you are sleepy. And If you are not really able to concentrate on study, maybe take  a time of 10-15 minutes for fun with your friends and you can study with healthier mind.\n\n Some says study with lot of people make you cannot concentrate on study, because the place is too noisy and you will want to talk with your friends. Well, these are partially true, but mostly not. Study with your friends doesn't mean 'noisy'. You can go cafe or study room with your friends. At there, group of student can study as usual. If you have questions or if you cannot really concentrate on study then you can rest just quarter hour. You can study quiet enough with your friend. There is also research result that white noise sometimes more profitable for study. And when you are alone, there is no person when you are wasting your time. Your friends might catch you up just hanging around and make you study agiain. Sharing  study result or study hours also might help for your will for study.\n\nThese are three reasons of my preference to study with group of students . I can share the difficulty of studying to ask questions around me, I am less tired when I'm not alone, and I can concentrate more with my friends. There are no correct answers for studying, but it is true that your friends give you happiness and help during the exam period. When you are really depressed, friends might be like a vitamin.

When I was young, to achieve my goals, I should study. Therefore someone would want to study with other people or alone. It will different because the habbit of someone to study is differerent. In my case, I love to study alone. I want to explain that reason.\n I am a student who have a mojor in biology department. To get a good score in biology department, I must memorize many things. When I was a second grade students, my final test range was ppt 1500 pages. It was very terrible. Anyway, I should memorize all of that. There are no other ways. Also, when we took the test, we should solve the problem alone. We can not debate with other students and see the other books or ppts. That is to say, I had to memorize all of things which I learned in my self. So, there are no reasons to study with other students. A group of students could not help me. To memorize all of things, I should study alone and fine the best way to memorize alone.\n Second, studying with a group of students interfere me. During the test period. My pattern changed enormously. Every day I slept only four hours a day and the time to sleep was changed. Therefore, sometimes I had a lunch at 3pm and I had a dinner at 4am. I guess the reason that my pattern was changed is that I focused on the study, I didn't have the time to take a dinner or lunch. However, if I studied with a group of students, I would take a lunch with that students and I would lost the chance that I could concentrate well. Also, if I studied with group of students, I would chat with those students. It is not helpful to me.\n I tried many ways to memorize all of things which I learned. Sometimes, I studied with my friends. But it never helped me, it interfered my study and take away my time. In the past, some friends asked me that study with my friends and take questions each other. It could be helpful if I checked the things that I memorized.

Putting unfamiliar things to our brain is hard and painful to everyone. To help this process, people ask help to others or study with others. However, I think studying alone is more benficial to me.\nFirst, studying increases my skill and knowledge better than the case of studying with a group of students. Some might say that if we study together, each others can help things that they do not know and make a synergy. However, those knowledges which are from peer groups are easily earned knowledges. The response to the question is immediate, and we can get the answer without an effort. If we study alone, new knowledges are usually earned with difficulty. We have to find internet, encyclopedia, and books to find a new information. Through this process, skills to find a new knowledge get improved. Additionaly, knowlledges which are earned with difficulty are hard to be forgotten.\nNext, studying with others is harmful for my concentration. With friends, there are so many chances to stop studying. They can always suggest to go out for a movie or beer while studying. Studying requires a high level concentration quite often, and friends are usually harmful to the concentration. People who prefer to study with others can say that studying with hard working friends will not harm their concentration. Even if everyone work hard, they all have a limit on their concentration, so at least one person in group is unconcentrated with high probability. As lose of concentration can be spread to others, studying with groups have higher chances to lose the concentration.\nSince studying is the major job of student, finding a good studying environment for individuals is important. I prefer studying alone, becasue studying alone increases my skill and knowledge, and studying with others is harmful for my concentration. I hope that everyone can find their own optimal studying environment and study hard all the time.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively argues that studying alone is more beneficial, as it mentions that 'knowledges which are earned with difficulty are hard to be forgotten,' but it lacks depth in exploring counterarguments or providing more detailed examples to strengthen its claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization of the essay is clear, with a logical flow from the introduction to the conclusion, yet the transitions between ideas could be smoother, particularly in the shift from discussing knowledge acquisition to concentration issues.\nJustification for Language: The language quality is generally good, but there are noticeable grammatical errors such as 'benficial' and 'becasue,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some people like to study alone, while others like to study together. I prefer to study with a group of students in three reasons, and I will explain why.\n\nFirst, if I study with friends who are taking the same class, I can ask questions to my friend and can see what I don't know. while I'm studying alone, I can't solve my curiousity right away. I should memorize what I don't know and ask questions to my friends or professor later. Also I should go without knowing to the next step. However, while I'm studying with a group, I can solve questions emmidiately and go to the next step smoothly.\n\nNext reason that I prefer to study with a group of students is concentration. I can concentrate on my study whlie I'm studying alone. However, if I study with a group, concentraion on my study becomes higher. There are so many  distractions such as cellphone, game, SNS, etc. Studying alone is hard to shake off obstacles, but it is possible if I study together. Once, I made a rule to play at a certaion time with the people I studied with, therefore I was able to concentrate on studying.\n\nLastly, if I study together, I can cheer up when studying is hard. Sometimes I want to give up because the subject I study is so difficult. Or there are times when I feel anxious because I don't have enough time to study. If I have a friends who studies with me, I am able to study with strength without give up.\n\nTo sum up, I prefer to study with a group of students because of three reasons. I hope you find a way to study well and study hard.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 reflects a strength in the author's ability to present three reasons for studying in a group, but it is weakened by the lack of depth in explanation, as seen in the statement 'there are times when I feel anxious because I don't have enough time to study,' which is not elaborated upon.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is supported by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct sections for each reason, but it is slightly marred by the abrupt transition in the last paragraph where the conclusion does not effectively summarize the main points.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is justified by the generally clear expression of ideas, yet it is diminished by several grammatical errors, such as 'emmidiately' instead of 'immediately' and 'concentraion' instead of 'concentration,' which detract from the overall clarity."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nIf you want to do something, it is important to know how to do that. In order to accomplish what you want, you need to study and develop yourself. There are two ways to study. One is studying alone and the other is studying with a group members. Each method has disadvantages and advantages, so there is no right answer.  It may depend on your personalities. Although some students prefer to study alone, I prefer to study with a group members.\n\n    First of All, studying alone can allure you not to fully concentrate on studying. There are no other people to prohibit you from the temptation. If the learning materials are so difficult, then I strongly want to do other things when I study alone. I usually watch youtube and playing games. However these are not actually taking a rest and these are easy to be addicted. The most important point is that these things that are not related to studying waste a lot of time. On the other hand, when we study with a group members, we have the group schedule for studying. Thus, we try not to broke the rule. In addition, one of the group member may prevent me doing other things. Thus, studying with a group members prohibit me not doing other things.\n\n    Next, some students who prefer study alone insist that they can manage their own tempo of studying. However, studying together has a more essential benefit which is helping each other with discussion. When I study mathematics, there are a lot of sophisticated concepts. If I can not understand these concepts by reading a book or googling, it took a lot of hours or days. Actually, these struggling time is valuable for mathematicians. However it is not an efficient since we are at the learning level. Despite taking a lot of time, we can solve it easily by disccusion with group members who study together. During the disccusion, we can know what we know and what we do not know. Moreover, this enhance our understanding of the problem. Moreover, I can aid other group members. Therefore, studying with a group members saves a lot of time and efforts.\n\n    In conclusion,  studying with a group members stop me not doing other things and it is more efficient. Although studying type depends on one's personality, I recommend you to study together. you will have a great accomplishment when you and your group members solve a problem that you can not solve alone. I think that group intelligence is greater than individual intelligence.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument in favor of studying in groups, but it lacks a deeper exploration of the disadvantages of group study, such as potential distractions or conflicts, which could strengthen the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate because the essay has a logical flow with clear topic sentences; however, the transition between ideas could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing the drawbacks of studying alone to the benefits of group study without sufficient connective phrases.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 reflects the overall clarity of expression, but there are multiple grammatical errors, such as 'a group members' instead of 'group members,' which detracts from the professionalism of the writing."}]}

Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nFor students, studying  with a group has been controversial. All students have different view on studying together or alone. Some of them feel that studying alone is better; however, others feel that studying  with a group is more helpful. Those who are in favor of studying alone believe that with a group, the students are likely to talk together rather than study together. In addition, they worry about the difference of abilities each has. Furthermore, they argue that it is more comfortable when you have a break time alone. Although there are quite plausible reasons to studying alone, I believe that studying with a group is better for other several reasons.\nFirst of all, many have stated that people usually want to talk or play if they gather. Once one student strat to talk to someone, then all together join the talk. They say it leads to not to study. It may seem reasonable, but they missed an important point. The group are constituted by people who want to study hard. Therefore, there can be some talk with each other but it will not last for a long time. If the talk keeps continuously, somebody will ask to stop it. Since they are willing to study hard, it is not a critical problem.\nIn addition to first, others assert that all the group members have different speed to study. They believe that this hinders for the members to study well; in fact, it is not true. According to a study by Seoul National Universtiy, it was found that students who studied with a group tend to show high performances than other students who studied alone. The tendency is verified numerically in the study; the students who studied with a group showed an increase of 33% in their scores, while the students who studied alon showed an increase of 14% in their scores. This result clearly support the fact that studying with a group is better than studying alone.\nThe last argument of those who trust that studying alone is better is that students feel stable when they rest alone in the break time. They insist that being together can be a stress for someone. If just feeling stable in the break time were the only concern, they might be correct. From a different point of view, however, it is not desirable. For example, if you are really tired because of the long-time studying and want talk to someone your difficulties, there should be someone talk with you. If you are alone, however, you cannot talk anyone and feel lonely. It will affect bad for your study.\nTo sum up, it is better to studying with a group than studying alone. First, you can study hard because the all group members are willing to study hard. Secondly, the study by Seoul National University verified that the effect of studying with a group is much better. Furthermore, if you study with somebody, you can enjoy your break time and study harder again. How about studying with a group if you want to expect to get higer performance?\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified because while the essay presents several arguments in favor of studying in groups, it lacks depth in addressing counterarguments, such as when it mentions that group members might have different study speeds without fully exploring how this can be managed or mitigated.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted as the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion; however, the transition between ideas could be improved, particularly in the statement 'In addition to first,' which is awkward and could confuse readers.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate since the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and sentence structure, but it contains several grammatical errors, such as 'the all group members' instead of 'all group members,' which detracts from the overall clarity of the writing."}]}

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nSome students prefer to study alone but the others do not. Why this happen? It is because there are not only advantages but also weaknesses. However, I prefer to study with others because I think that advantages are stronger than weaknesses. Morevoer, advantages can cover weaknesses. From now  on, I will tell you why I  think like that and rebut opposite arguments.\n\n Firstly, there is opposite argument such that studying alone is more efficient than studying together because when you study alone, you can stduy the only part that you want. Moreover, when you finish understanding some parts, then you can pass and study other parts. It is their opinion. However, I think studying together is more efficient because if there are some parts that you cannot understand, then you have to spend a lot of time and effort. In this situation other students can help you understanding by explaining their thoughts. Therefore, you can easily pass that part. In my case, when I study some difficult topic about AI and there is no improvement of studying because it is too hard. However, after my friends give me some advise, I realize my mistake that I misunderstand definition and finally I can pass that part. If he did not help me, I would give up.\n\n Next,  there is opposite argument such that studying together needs a lot of resources such as time and effort of relationship. However, I think it can also be the big advantages. Firstly, for time, it is because you can use time with concentration. When you study with you friends, you have to do your work on time. It makes you not waste the time. Moreover, for the effort of relation ship, it can be difficult to make a good relationship. Although it can be stressful to make a relationship, you can make a friend and they can help you when you need. Also, they can help your studying. I think those are great advantages. I also ask something to my friend who become friendly after doing the group coursework together.\n\n To sum up, there are some advantages and disadvantages. I think there are more advantages than disadvantages. Moreover, I think working together not only for studying but also other things is worthy even if there are some difficulities such as time or effort of making good relationship. After you work together, you can realize that. Let's study together!\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects a clear argument in favor of studying with others, as seen in the example where the author describes how friends helped them understand a difficult topic about AI, but the essay could benefit from more detailed exploration of the disadvantages of studying alone to provide a more balanced perspective.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is due to the somewhat unclear structure, particularly in the transition between points; for instance, the shifts from discussing the efficiency of studying alone to the benefits of studying together lack smooth transitions that would enhance overall coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is justified by the author's generally effective use of English, although there are noticeable errors such as 'stduy' instead of 'study' and awkward phrasing like 'effort of relationship,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nNowadays, more and more courses in university teach students to study in group. There are somes students who prefer to study alone, and not in a group. They think that studying together would reduce the speed of studying. They also believe that most of the students they study with would stop studying in the middle of the process, which would  affect them. Lastly, They also belive that if they study together in a group, they would not learn things in depth. Altough these reasons may seem quite fair in first glance, I belive that these reasons contains some logical errors, which is why I think that studying with a group of students is much better than studying alone.\n\nFirstly, One of the reasons that some students prefer to study alone is that they think studying in a group is much more slower. However, I think this is not true. Studying in a group can enhance the overall speed of learning. If we are studying alone, we cannot get help from anyone even when we are stuck. In contrast, if we study with the group of students, group members can help each other to move on, by sharing the understanting. For this reason, I think that studying together can be much more faster than studying alone.\n\nSecondly, some students fear group studying because other students in group may stop learning in the middle stage. They believe this could affect them, as well. However, I believe this is absolutely false. Recent statistics show that students who study alone has twice more likely to stop learning in the middle of the process. This phenomenon can be explained by the \"collaborative work effect\". Collaborative work effect is the effect that people tend to work harder if there are co-workers who work on the samething. Co-workers would motivate each other while working, which makes less failure within the group. Likewise, studying in a group would make students study until the end. \n\nLast, and most importantly, some students may think that if they study with a group of students, they would not learn things in depth. They believe this is true because they cannot set the speed of learning in their own; even if they want to stop a while and ponder on something.  However, this is not true because group of students can always teach each other in depth. If we want to understand some concept in depth, we may just ask \"I want to know this concept in depth.\" to the group members. Now, compare to the process of studying alone, we can always get a great help from our group members. As you can see, studying together in a group can definitely help to study in depth compare to studying alone.   \n\nTo sum up, I believe that studing in a group is  much more effective than studying alone. Studying with group of students may enhance the overall speed of learing. It may also help students to finish studying until the end,  and accomplish the goal. Finally, students can teach their group members so they can learn in depth compare to studying alone.  Next time if you have to study something, you may make a study group to study together, which will be a great help!\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's strong argument for group study, particularly in the second paragraph where it cites 'recent statistics' to support the claim that students studying alone are more likely to stop learning, though the lack of specific data undermines the strength of this point.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay, with distinct paragraphs addressing different arguments, but the use of phrases like 'Last, and most importantly' could be streamlined for better flow.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is supported by generally strong vocabulary and sentence structure, although errors such as 'belive' and 'understanting' indicate areas where proofreading could improve clarity."}]}

However,  study with group members can supplement weakness by cooperation. Each of us has a different field of confidence. For example, Someone is strong in math, but weak in physics. Therefore, if we become teachers for subjects that we are not confident about, we can fill in our shortcomings.\n Others argue that, study with others decreases the learning efficiency. However, It is only 5~10% learning efficiency, if we read only textbook. With discussion or ask and answer, It improves efficiency up to 90%.\n To sum up, we can improve the learning efficiency by discussion and becoming others teacher.

To improve their lives, every students studies hard. But, there is a difference in the way of studying. Some students likes to study alone, meanwhile others prefer to study with a group. Despite of the argument, I believe that studying with group is better way.\n\n The first reasons why some students prefer to study alone is that they can concentrate on studying. They might say \"if we study in a group, we can't concentrate on reading books and it leads us to mass up.\" But, focusing on studying alone is not the best way. Rather than that, making a group and teaching someone will increase your understanding. Understanding is totally different with teaching. Even though you understand all things and can solve any problems, you might not teach the knowledge. To teach someone, students should know all principle and can interpret the knowledge with your own words. In this process, you might find what you missed or more developed knowledge. The way of teaching can be only worked when you study in a group.\n\n In addition to the first reason, group studying students can get another advantage, 'Fun'. Study alone is boring. People who study alone can just read books, and watch lecture. It is the fastest path to go sleep. However, if you study with group, you can do it with fun. You can ask something to your friends or do quiz to check your understanding. Studying with group makes the way of studying broad.\n\n Last, studying with group is helpful to your future work. Almost jobs need to co-work with colleagues. If you had studied alone, you may ruined co-working. By group studying, you can practice your future job.\n\n There is no perfect way of studying. You can study alone if you want to do. But, if you don't have any unique way of studying, I suggest you to study with your friends, because of benefits such as teaching and learning systems, fun studying, and your future. Please notice that effects of group studying come from when you do hard work. Then, you will get success in your exam.  \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument in favor of group studying, but it lacks a deeper exploration of counterarguments, as seen in the simplistic mention of studying alone as 'not the best way.'\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is warranted because the essay has a logical structure with clear paragraphs, yet the transitions between ideas could be improved, such as the abrupt shift from discussing concentration to the benefits of fun without a smooth connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate since the essay generally uses clear language, but it contains grammatical errors, such as 'some students likes' instead of 'some students like,' which detracts from the overall clarity."}]}

Some people say that studying alone is the best way to study. Others say that studying with other students is better than studying alone. In my opinion, studying with a group of students is better than studying alone.\nFirst of all, some people say that in case of studying with a group of students, students would spend time to talk with others. However, students can study efficiently through studying with other students. The reason of the efficiency is that students can share opinions with others. Assume that someone doesn't know about something that he or she is studying. If he or she studies alone, he or she should find it in the textbook or should search it on the Internet. On the other hand, if he or she is studying with his or her group members,  they can know about it immediately by sharing ideas. Because of this, students who study with others can spend less time than students who study alone. \nSecond, there are some people who believe that students who study alone can concentrate fully on studying something. However, students who study with their group members can concentrate better on studying something. This is because of the atmosphere to study. When someone is studying, the environment affects him or her a lot. If students study with others, they cannot do other things like playing games because other students are study hard around them. Therefore, group study can increase the concentration of the students.\nFinally, some people argue that students should not study with friends when they are studying. However, studying with other students can make close friendship with them. One of the most important purposes which the education has is the friendship of students. However, if students do not study with others, they would find other ways to make friends. On the other hand, students who study with their group members can easily get closed with them. \nIn conclusion, studying with group members is the better way to study than studying alone. Some people argue that studying alone is better than studying with a group of students. However, group study have higher efficiency, higher concentration. In addition, students can have close relationship between other students by studying with them. I hope that students can study efficiently by studying with a group of students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's clear argument that group studying is superior to studying alone; however, it lacks depth in exploring counterarguments, as seen in the brief mention of studying alone without providing substantial reasoning against it.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified by the clear structure of the essay with distinct paragraphs for each point; however, the transition between ideas could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing efficiency to concentration without a clear linking statement.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate given the generally clear expression of ideas, but the essay contains grammatical errors, such as 'group study have higher efficiency' instead of 'group study has higher efficiency,' which detracts from the overall quality."}]}

Likewise the saying, each student has different style of study. We can divide the students roughly in two groups: who like to study alone, and who like to study within friends.

However, this is inefficient way to understand something. One person cannot fully understand whole thing about what he or she learns. It is because each student has each one\u2019s point of veiw or frame to the world, and we can miunderstand what the instuctional document says. Additionally, it will take long time to understand totally new concept for the beginner. By studying with others, we can cover thes defacts. If several students share their understanding about one concept, they could see varying aspects of the idea and it would lead to their deep understanding. Thus, when the students share their understanding, they talk about it, they listen about it, and they write about it addition to just reading it. It helps we repeat the contents what we are learning and understand well. \n\nSecondly, students who study alone argue that they can manage their time in the way they want and it is the most efficient way to study. When the students enter the university, they encounter may enjoyable things such as video games, movies, and beds we can sleep. They have freedom with their behavior, and easily want to be comfortable with those things especially when we are alone. However if we are with friends who have same goal, to understand a certain concept, we cannot do other things. We can more focus on the concept without thinking other peripheral things.\n\nIn conclusion, this essay argue that studying in a group of students is more efficient than the studying alone.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n\nEssay to evaluate:\nDuring the exam period, KAIST students study according to their own study style. Some students study alone in the dormitory or library, and another students study together in a classroom. Some people say that studying with a group of students can cause you to lose concentration and interfere. However, this should not be seen as a problem.  Rather, group studying helps to improve study efficiency.\n\nUntil now, many have argued that people become nosiy when they study together. If you study alone, you just blank out of a while.  However, you can waste all your time for chatting when you study with your friends. Maybe, but when you're with the friends, you could save time to waste. For example, when studying alone, there is no one watching, so you keep looking at your cell phone. On the other hand, if you study with a group, another friend can give you a warning whenever you don't concentrate on studying.\n\nThere is an advantage when you study with a group of students.  It is easy to solve your curiosity  if you study together. When you are alone, you can solve the problem through only the internet. Or, you have to ask someone else later, so it's hard to solve the curiosity right away. However, you can have a discussion about the problem when you study with your friends. Also, there might be a student who has the same question as you. Or, you may already have a friend who knows the answer to the question. You can share your knowledge with each other and study more deeply.\n\nTo sum up, study efficiency is increasing when you study with a group of students. First, you can concentrate on studying  because your frends can give a caution. Also, you can study more deeply for a discussion with your study members. What about study with your friends? You can get higher score for your test.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified because the essay presents a clear argument in favor of group studying, such as stating, 'group studying helps to improve study efficiency,' but lacks sufficient depth and supporting evidence, such as specific studies or statistics that could strengthen the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay generally follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, yet the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly when shifting from discussing concentration to solving curiosity, which feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is fitting because the essay uses mostly clear and effective language, but it contains several grammatical errors, such as 'another students' instead of 'other students,' which detracts from overall clarity."}]}

Sometimes, we hate the studying because it is so boring and difficult. According to statistics from Nelson, 88% of Korean high school students have experienced the feeling of stop studying during exam period. Accordingly, we should consider most effective way to study and concentrate for learning. Although some argue that they prefer to study alone, I believe that studying with a group is the better choice.\n\nFirst of all, many have argued that the surrounding study environment of students should be quite for concentrating. They believe that just quite condition is the best for students. However, according to research, some noise is helpful to concentrating on something(Choi). For example, many students find the cafe because they can feel more comfortable in the condition of enough noise. If you study with your friends, you can talk with them in the rest time, so it may encourage you for keep studying. \n\nNext, some argue that students will not study because they just chat with each other. However, there are several benefit of group studying that overcome the risk of chatting each other. The group member may be able to help you to solve the assignment. For example, in the case of KAIST, the assignment problems are usually difficult, and many students may not solve them alone. If you study with your department friends, they can share the solutions or ideas, and they will solve the problems together. Also, according to research, students who study with a group make more advanced and creative solution for social problem(Bai). Therefore, we can expect the great effect of group study.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that studying with a group is more effective for students. If you meet your friends and study together, you can also learn the social relationship. You will discuss, share the idea, and make decision with agreement of all group member. \n\n\n\nSources:\n1.

There are many trade-off using each methods. Studying with other friends can improve the efficiency of study, exciting. Nevertheless, I prefer to study alone rather than group study. I have several reasons and examples in this opinion.\n\n First of all, some of guys said that studying each other is helpful for efficiency. They argue that when problems occur during study, they can discuss and evaluate each other. But I think it is not for everyone. In my case, group study was not efficient for me. When I was a junior, I studied Engineering math with my friend. We also helped each other, but we discussed the problems based on uncertainty. It caused the failure of that class. I think all students are not the expert of specific subjects, It would be better study alone and discuss with professors or teaching assistants rather than friends. I got A+ after that semester. In that reason, I studied alone and discussed with professors.\n\n  Second, some of students argued that group study is exciting. When they feel boring while studying with others, it's good opportunity to play and rest. Although rest while studying is important, I think it's not a proper way that studying each other. In my experience,  I studied with my girlfriend for all exam durations. When she wanted to rest and play, I also rest with her even though I'm not ready to finish my work. And vice versa. It was very unefficienct for study, we finally got the lowest grades. After that semester, we studied seperately during the exam weekend. We could fully focus on own study and rest.\n\n In conclusion, the group study and studying alone have own advantages. some people prefer group study because they feel efficiency, exciting while studying.

Obiously, that is a study. Every student do their study by own ways. There are so many strategies to achieve a knowledge and learn something such as studying alone or studying with a group of students. However, I prefer to study with a group of students. There are some advantages than alone.\nFirst of all, students with other students can study efficiently. They can divide a textbook with several chapters, take each parts for explanation to others.Using this strategy, each student can study only small parts of the textbook. So, they have a less stress from amounts of exam range. In fact, I often used this way with my friend. Then, I got a good grade of some biological classes. Because students who study together can save the time to prepare exam, studying together is a efficient study style.\nNext, some students who prefer to study alone say that students prevent each other from concentration to study. However, I do not think so. In my case, students who study with others can check each others whether they think of only study or not. Then, it is able to make good mood for study. Therefore, making the group is good way to concentrate with study.\nTo sum up, there are some advantages of studying together such as efficient learning, help concentrate.

Some people prefer to study alone while other people prefer to study with a group of students. Students who prefer the group studing say they can be motivated by their group members and can use a large seminar room. Despite these advantages, I prefer to study alone for some reasons.\n First,  students who prefer a group studying think that the group members can motivate them to study hard. It is partially true, but I think it doesn't make sense for all cases. It is because this also means we can be easily unmotivated by other group members. For example, other group member might tell us to go out while we are studying. Moreover, when we study with others, it is easy to be disturbed by their noise. In addition, to study with a group of students, we should meet at specific time. However, the group members are not always available, so  it is hard to meet to study together. Therefore, we cannot use our time fluently. However, in case of studying alone, we can concentrate our own work without disturbance and can use our time more fluently. \n Second, some people prefer to study with a group of students since they can use the school seminar room which needs 4 people to make reservation. However, this also means that it is hard for group to find a suitable studying place. In fact, it is hard to seat together with a group in library. In many cases, they have to be split. Or, they have to move another place to have a seat. In other words, studying with a group of students have some space limitation. However, when we study alone, we don't need to worry about to get a seat in library. It is more easier to get one seat in library.\n In conclusion, for me, studying alone is better than studying with a group of students. It is because studying alone allow us to study without interrupt with others. In addition, studying alone make us to use our time more efficiently and has less space limitation compare with studying with a group. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay effectively presents the argument for studying alone, but it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or evidence to support the claim that studying alone is more efficient, such as personal experiences or studies on effective study methods.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is warranted because the essay has a clear structure with distinct introductory and concluding sections, but it lacks smoother transitions between ideas, such as when moving from the discussion of motivation to the challenges of group study, which could enhance overall coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is supported by generally clear expression and varied sentence structure; however, there are grammatical errors present, such as 'studing' instead of 'studying' and awkward phrases like 'make reservation,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some students prefer to study alone, others prefer to study with his friends. Some students prefer to study in place that is very quite like library, othres prefer to study in place that is noisy like cafe. There is so many style that people study, and we have to choose our own style that is most efficiency. Among them, I prefer to study alone. I'll mention why I prefer to study alone.\n First, Studying with a group of students is unefficient for me. I have active characteristic. So, when I study with my friends, I spend the most of time to talking with my friends. I really like talking with my friends. so when I study with my friends, I spend 3 minutes of a hour to study and 57 minutes of a hour to talk my stories that is funny to my friends. It is unefficiency way to study hard. But when I study alone, there is anyone that I can talk my story, so I spend most of time to studying hard. So, Studying alone is efficiency way to study for me.\n Moreover, Studying with a group of students is not necessary for me. I only ask questions to teaching assistants or professor, so studying with a group of friends is not necessary for me. The advantage of studying with a group of students is that we can ask questions to each others. But, I can't believe the answer that my friends answerd is correct. So, I only ask questions to teaching assistants or professor because I want to get a exact answer. So, studying with a group of students is not necessary to me.\n Finally, I can study with great feeling when I study alone. I like to sing songs when I am studying. When I sing songs, I feel great and happy. So, I can study hard with happy feeling when I sing songs during I am studying. It is also help to refresh my brain. However, when I study with a group of students, I can't sing songs during I'm studying. Because It is good for my feeling, but It is terrible for their feeling who study with me. So, I prefer to study alone to sing songs during I am studying.\n In conclusion, I prefer more studying alone than studying with a group of students. There is three reasons. Studying with a group of students is unefficient for me due to my active characteristic, Studying with a group of students is not necessary for me because I never ask questions to other people except teaching assistants or professor, and Studying alone is good for my feeling because I can sing songs during I am studying. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects the essay's clear perspective on preferring to study alone, but it is weakened by a lack of depth in the explanations, such as the vague assertion that studying with friends leads to inefficiency without providing specific examples of how this affects the author's study outcomes.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified by the logical structure of the essay, which includes a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on a specific reason for studying alone, and a concise conclusion, although the transition between ideas could be smoother.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is supported by several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'unefficient' instead of 'inefficient' and 'there is anyone that I can talk my story,' which hinder the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

However, it is not true. Actually, you can control talking with your freinds if you have passion to study. Also, it will be more helpful if you study with your friends. You can ask some contents that you cannot understand to your friends immediately.  You can discuss creative ideas or thoughts with your friends. If you missed some part of  lecture, you can learn to your friends.\n       Finally, some students don\u2019t want to share their materials with their friends because they are also competitors.

One example that shows this circumstance is that some students prefer to study alone, while other prefer to study as a group. I prefer to study alone because it is more efficient and is a more active way of learning.\n Others claim that it is more efficient to study with a group of students, because they think it is efficient. However, I strongly disagree to this claim. I think it is much efficient to study alone. When we study alone, we can concentrate better because you are exposed to less temptations. Most of the study groups that I saw eventually never worked out. They seemed to have too much fun or become too competitive. Even though the study group maintains to function well, I think the process of understanding and memorizing should be done individually in the end. This means that you have to go over and study the materials by yourself, which is not an efficient way to spend your time. Also, in order to meet study groups regurarly you need to match all the schedules with group memebers, which can be time consuming and cumbersome.\n Some people say that we need study groups to prevent studying passively. Nevertheless, I think that we can study much more actively when we study alone. If you have a study group, you ask your questions to your friends. This may appear to be active process, but in fact it is a mere shortcut. It is not helping your academic skills. . For instance, I once asked questions to my friend who takes the same class. There  was concepts where she explained wrongly, and we both got bad results. This would not have happened if we were not so convinced that we can rely on each other. The better way would have been googling, searching books and asking questions to professors, since we have professors and teaching assistants that will give us better answers. Thus, sometimes study groups prevent you from studying more actively. \n To sum up, I prefer to study alone, because it is more efficient and it is a way to study more actively.

Some students prefer to study with club members and some use study group to get infromation about test. In my case, I prefer to study alone. Thus, I will talk you why I prefer to study alone.  \n     First of all, I want to study at silent space. If I study at a noisy situation, I can't focus on studying. For example, there are a lot of people that do something such as drinking coffee or talking with their friends. All the noise in the cafe will be bothering me. Therefore, It cause very low efficiency of studying. Thus, I won't be able to finish my all works.    \n     Next, It is better to read a book than to  share opinions. Opinions of friends may not be accurate. For example, If I study alone, I try to check my book to find concept that I was confused or  I can't be memorable. This method is clear, so  there is no need to worry about certainty.\n     Last, It helps to save time. When time is running out, we don't have time such as moving other place. If I do study group, I have to ready my part and explain it to others. Therefore, study alone helps to save time. \n     To sum up, I explain why study alone is better. Because of slient and queit situation, we can focus on something well. And It also help to get accurate information by using book directly.

Some of them prefer to study alone, and others prefer to study in group. Those who prefer to study alone insist that they can more concentrate on their study when they study alone. Although there are some advantages of studying alone, I believe that study with a group of students is more efficient way to study.\n\n    First, many have argued that study with a group is waste of time. They insist that if they study together, they feel that they are wasting a time discussing about what they already aware. However, in the process of studying together, we can realize that our misunderstaning knowledge that we thought that have understood. In addition, we can organize the contents by explaining our understanding of knowledge to our friends, and evaluate my understanding. Also, we can accumulate knowledge by asking our friends about things that we did not know or not sure. Therefore, study with a group is more better way to study in terms of efficiency.\n\n    Others argue that, study with a group is harder to concentrate than studying alone. In other words, they claim that if they study with their friends, they will have a chat any will not be able to focus on their studies. However, studies have shown that most people experience more efficiency when they study with their friends. According to statistics from the National Institute of Education, studying in a group showed much more achievement on the exam comparing with studying alone. The researchers conducted an experiment in two groups of students in the fourth grade(about B0) of the mock test of korean SAT. Group A studied alone, and Group B studied by sharing opinions with their group. After three months, the average grade of mock test was 4.2, while Group B\u2019s average test grade was 3.3. Also, the post survey result show that the feeling of concentration also high-rated on Group B compared with Group A. The study results directly refute the opposition insisted that studying together reduces concentration. \n\n\n    In conclusion, although studying alone has some benefits, to study as a group showed two benefits compared to study alone. The first factor is that the efficiency of studing has increased, and the second factor is that they could concentrate more easily with studying in a group.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay presents a clear argument in favor of group study, supported by specific examples like the mention of a study conducted on fourth graders, though it lacks depth in exploring counterarguments, which weakens its overall content strength.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is generally well-organized with a clear introduction and conclusion, but the transition between points could be improved, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing the first argument to the second without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: While the essay demonstrates a good command of language, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'more better way to study,' which detract from the clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

For example, in KAIST, students can study in group study room. We can talk freely about some questions. In contrast, there are some places where students should not talk with friends. They study in separated rooms and they need to keep their mouths for other people around them. Some students prefer to study alone because they don\u2019t like studying with friends talking. However, I will give two reasons that I like study with a group of students.\n\n\nFirst, opponents insist that it is hard to concentrate on their own study when they study with friends. However, we can study efficiently with a group of students because friends could look whether we study or not . In my experience, I could study hard with friends because my friends said that you should study hard when I didn\u2019t concentrate on my work. Through their looking, I spent my time not in plaing but in studying.\n\nSecondly, the objection is that  studying alone gives more opponities to learn because students can search through Internet sources. However, we can study efficiently with a group of students through questions. I can ask questions to smart friends. For instance, I was given several advices by my friends, and thanks to that, I could get A+. I talked about why I thought the process is wrong, and friends give another sight.  Friends could give good explanations about your questions.\n\nTo sum up, oppoenets insist that students could not concentrate on their own study, and they lose opponities to study through Internet sources. However, students could learn easily with friends. They can concentrate on studying because friends look whether they study or not and they can ask questions to fridends.

Some people believe that college or university education should be available for good students. Although that university education should be approachable for just some students is common, university for everyone have more benefits. \nTo begin with, it can grow up many smart students. These days, many students give up to enhance their ability because of expensive university expenses. Therefore, if university education is approachable for every student, students can study the subjects that they are interested in and they can be good expertise in that fields. It is good for not only the students but also society because many good expertise means many people do well in each part of society.\nIn addition to developing students\u2019 ability, it can grow up citizen\u2019s quality. This is because common university education makes many people attend universities, so it can teach them not only knowledge but also common sense and rules for society. Although getting high education is not equal to being right person, high education tends to make people be right. \nSome argue that it just wastes money; because many students are not interested in study, they are not suitable for being expertise. However, it is not true every student don\u2019t need to go university, they can easily drop their courses if they think the courses are not suitable for them. \nTo sum up, common university education makes good expertise for each field and grow up citizen\u2019s quality.

Although some people believe that a college or university education should be available only good students, the higher education should be available to all students. Two reasons support this argument: opportunities to learn of students, and potential of students.\n     First of all, society should give opportunities to learn to students. Learning is very important to everybody, but the opportunities to learn have been restricted to someone who does not show great grade. However, it should be changed because students still have right to study what they want and avoid discrimination by grade. \n     In addition to opportunities to learn, students have potential. As all people know, people show great power on site what they love. Students will have a big potential in major what they have interest, so they could be a great people on their major part if they can take higher education on their interesting major. Students who learn more about what they want will positively affect to society. \n     Some argue that it is effective to select students and focus on them for society. However, that argue has a big problem; grade don not say everything about students; for example, there are students who show the best performance on the university even though they were not exceptional students in high school. High school grades may say ability of taking a grade, but it can not say everything about students.\n     To sum, Students should be able to get higher education. They have right to learn what they want, and that right will give positive effect to society. Society should go to direction where all people are encouraged to learn what they want.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument that higher education should be available to all students, but it lacks detailed examples and evidence to strongly support its claims, such as providing statistics or specific case studies of students who thrived despite lower grades.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay has a logical structure with clear paragraphs, but it suffers from occasional awkward transitions, such as the abrupt shift between discussing opportunities and potential without a strong connecting statement.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 reflects the presence of several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as in the phrase 'grade don not say everything about students,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Since ancient times, education was an essential base for having or initiating a developed and improved civilization. However, nowadays, several people think that the opportunity of higher education should be given to good students, who do well in certain studies, only, and in my opinion, in this life, everyone deserves to have such an opportunity for several reasons.\n     First of all, some people argue that letting average-skilled people to take courses in a higher level of education is waste of money and time; in addition, they think that focusing on only good students will allow professors to explain contents fast and well, and that kind of action may lead to a rapid increase in students\u2019 performance and participation. Their plan is creating a society where above the average students lead or control average or below the average students in every work field. \n     Giving the opportunity of education to only a certain group of people is indeed a wrong decision because since old times, people aim and pay efforts endlessly to have a stable society where everyone stays on the same level and has the same opportunity of living. Such a decision will only bring harm to this world, and it may increase the number of crimes in several regions of nations. \n     In addition, that kind of decision faces a disagreement from many sides because the only way to improve a certain society is to increase the number of learners. Having more students is sure a good sign for creating new paths in learning and teaching as well; moreover, being good in school doesn\u2019t mean doing well in college or university. Some people may do bad in their period of studying in high schools, but they show an increase in their performance once they enter the university. \n     To conclude, every student deserves to have the same opportunity of education as everyone else. Some people think that giving such an opportunity to a certain group of people will save money and time but unfortunately, it goes the opposite way. The more students you have in your country, the more improvements your country will approach to, and encouraging people to study or continue their studies is the base for such improvements.  \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5/5 reflects the essay's strong argument for the inclusivity of education, as seen in the assertion that 'every student deserves to have the same opportunity of education as everyone else,' but it is slightly weakened by the lack of concrete examples or data to support the claims made about societal benefits.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0/5 is justified because the essay follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion, though transitions between ideas could be improved; for instance, the shift from discussing societal stability to the consequences of limited educational opportunities feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0/5 is appropriate as the essay uses generally clear and coherent language, but it suffers from some grammatical errors, such as 'letting average-skilled people to take courses,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

No university is allowed to everyone, and some people say that universities should open their sources for education to all students who want to learn that course. Although it is good way to reduce the gap of education, it is almost impossible for university to open their course to everyone. Higher education should be available only to selected students.\nFirst of all, it is clear that the quality of education will become lower when it is served to more students. When the number of students grow bigger, it will be hard to get all questions from students. Students can not hear the lecture well when the classroom is too large for many students. Also, students will fill harder to ask questions about their lecture with too many students; instructors will fill harder to understand their students understood their lecture or not. The course become not efficient with too many students, and it is why many current courses have their upper limit of students.\nMoreover, universities can not afford all students when anyone can participate in their course. Most courses do not only do lecture, but they contain several homework, quizzes, and tests. With too many students, universities will not afford to maintain their course as when with smaller number of students. Especially, courses containing argument in class will be almost impossible to participate all students who want to hear. It makes the actual problem when everyone can join the class.\nSome argue that although some inefficiency exists, universities should open their lecture to everyone who want to hear that lecture for the equality for education. However, they should recognize that universities are not for charity. Universities already selected students and focus on them to invest; furthermore, the ways of selection are fair. People who want to study course of universities should take exam for admission, and go to the university to get that course. Since all university students do this to participate in the course, it becomes unfair when others can just hear lecture when they want to participate.\nIt is very important that all people should be treated equally, and they should be able to learn what they want. However, learning something have their own tracks. People who want to hear university courses should become the university student; otherwise, it is not fair to university students who studied hard to become the students of that university. Moreover, participating every people have some actual problems like the quality problem or the fact that university can not afford it. Courses in university should be opened only to university students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects a strong argument but is weakened by the lack of specific evidence or examples to support claims, such as when the essay states, 'the quality of education will become lower when it is served to more students' without further elaboration.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay follows a logical structure with clear transitions, yet it suffers from some repetitive ideas, such as reiterating the inefficiency of large classes without introducing new perspectives or examples.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate due to frequent grammatical errors, such as 'fill harder' instead of 'feel harder,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Some believe that the country can develop when everyone has a higher education. Although some say that higher education has to be for everyone, it should be available only to good students for several reasons. \nFirst of all, students can regret choosing unwanted majors. When students are in high school, it is rare for them to clearly decide on their own career path; therefore, students go to university without deep thoughts. To be specific, students in Korea go to university according to their grades, and there is a high probability that this does not match their aptitude. This often leads to regret.\nIn addition to regret postponing decisions about career, false sense of society that everyone must attend college can arise. Even if the college major does not match people, it is not easy for them to quit colleges. This is because of the social perception that most students have to attend college. To be specific, many students over the country who graduate their meaningless college life prepare for public servants in Korea.\nSome oppose to higher education for good students because of the develop for country. Many ways to improve the country without graduating from college exist. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs started a big company even if they did not graduate from college. In addition, many ways to develop the country without graduating from college, such as doing volunteer work for others exist.\nTo sum up, only some students need to go to college for several reasons. In this way, they will not regret their choices and social awareness will grow right. Students need to seriously think about their college admissions.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 reflects a solid argument, but it is weakened by the lack of specific examples or evidence to support the claim that higher education should be limited to good students; for instance, the mention of Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs is not fully developed to illustrate the broader implications of this argument.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is justified as the essay has a clear structure, but it could be improved by providing smoother transitions between ideas, such as the abrupt shift from discussing regret to societal perceptions of college attendance without a clear connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 indicates some effective communication but is hindered by grammatical issues and awkward phrasing, such as 'the develop for country' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the essay."}]}

Most of all students study hard to enter better college or university until their high school. Even though it is the fact that the lecture of college and university provides more advanced things than high school, it does not mean every student need higher education. To provide higher education only to good students has several benefits than to all students.\nFirst of all, to give chance of higher education to every student is extremely expensive. Programs and lectures in college and university are different with previous ones; they require numbers of expensive tools, extra space, and more experts such as professor. For example, to open a chemistry class, a lot of chemicals, flasks, and even professors are required.\nNext, higher education is never necessary for everyone. Commonly, things that students learn from college or university are not directly related to real-world things because they learn a lot of latest and advanced theory in their major. For instance, while all of KAIST students learn calculus and physics in 1st grade, but most of them are useless: such as line integration, surface integration, and wave function theory.\nAlthough some still claim providing higher educations only to good students harms an equality in education. However, they have to consider whether it is real equality or not. If college or university education is available to all students, most of students will take higher education even they are not interested in studying; it may consume students\u2019 time to develop themselves in other categories. \nTo sum up, to give a chance of higher education only to good students have several benefits than to all students. While an equality in education can be a problem with this selective higher education, selective higher education can provide more chance and positive effect to students who may be victim in selective higher education.

In Korea, elementary school, middle school, and first year of high school is regulated as compulsory education, Korean students must complete this curriculum unless they have a special reason. However, in the case of higher education, there are many pros and cons as to whether it should be provided to all students or not. In my opinion, higher education should only be provided to some of the best students for the following reasons.\nFirst of all, providing higher education to every student wastes money, time and manpower. Just because every student has a higher education does not mean they understand it. Higher education literally means \u2018intensified' education for some subject. In other words, students who do not have sufficient prior knowledge in that field may have a difficulty to understand the higher education. Giving higher education to students who do not understand is a waste of time, money and manpower.\nIn addition to waste of sources problem, providing higher education to only excellent students will help students find their real value. Everyone has their own talents. That talent could be study, dance, or song. Depending on these talents, everyone will choose a different job. In this case, many jobs in society all demand different skill, but higher education could not educate all these skills. As in following example, the skill needed by a tile mechanics is to squeeze silicone well, not to solve calculus problems well. Rather, higher education in mathematics will only take effect when it is provided to a friend who is good at math. \nUntil now, many have argued that not providing higher education to all is a violation of the principle of equality. However, providing opportunities of higher-education only to good students can prevents all students from taking the same career path. For example, in Korea nowadays, higher education opportunities are available to all students. Therefore, a great part of Korean high school students enter college unconditionally, even if they do not have a subject they want to learn at college. The main reason for this is that the social perception sees students who didn't go to college as losers. I think this problem can be prevented if college education in a specific field is provided only to students who are excellent in a specific field.\nIn conclusion, allowing higher education only to excellent students prevents wasted money, time and manpower and helps students create individual their value. Korean society considers those who cannot go to college as losers. However, this is a misconception. Even if some students do not have a college education, but they know their true worth and works on their dreams, they will be a real success.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 14.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 5.0/5 is justified as the essay effectively argues that higher education should be reserved for the best students by providing clear reasoning and examples, such as the point about the skills required for various professions that do not necessarily need higher education.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5/5 is supported by the logical flow of ideas, though the essay could benefit from clearer transitions between paragraphs to enhance coherence, such as better linking the discussion of societal perceptions to the argument about individual talents.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5/5 reflects the overall clarity and effectiveness of the writing, but is slightly hindered by grammatical issues, such as the phrase 'create individual their value,' which contains a grammatical error that detracts from the overall professionalism of the essay."}]}

Not only the pandemic, but many industries and new technologies are emerging and developing in the world under the wave of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Therefore, not only excellent medical personnel but also engineering personnel are required in society. There are two reasons that all people should need a higher level of education.\nFirst, as society becomes more complex and develops, high-quality manpower is required in any field. However, the supply of manpower is not sufficient as necessary. For example, now, with the combination of IT and objects such as IOT, not only IT but also knowledge about objects must be made. Students have to learn a lot in college in order to have the diverse knowledge thus it is difficult to know both IT and objects, human resources are not supplied as much as society needs. As society becomes more complex and requires more and more smart talent, it is necessary to provide higher education opportunities to all students.\nIn addition to, it is a very important solution to overcome the low birth rate problem. In Korea, the total birth rate is less than one. In the past, there were so many children that it was enough to have some smarts. However, in the current society, there are not many children due to low birth rates, so everyone should be smart. Now everyone must do their own role at society. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of low birth rate, all children must be well educated and sent to society.\nSome argue that, society has a limited budget and it is impossible to educate everyone. This criticism is correct only in developing countries. In the case of Korea, it is a country with a budget of over 500 trillion won per year and it is developed country. In the case of developed countries, budgets are sufficient, but education budgets are insufficient due to other priorities. Education determines the future of the country, so adequate education budget is required.\nTo sum up, in order to solve many problems in the current society, it is necessary to provide opportunities for university education to all people. Education should be viewed as a point of investment for the future. Ten dollars of investment in education now will return to ten thousand dollars in the future. Provide college education opportunities for everyone.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively highlights the importance of higher education in addressing societal challenges, but it lacks depth in its argumentation, particularly in the second reason where the claim regarding low birth rates is not sufficiently supported with data or analysis.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is generally well-organized with a clear introduction and conclusion, but the transition between the points could be improved, as the abrupt shift from discussing high-quality manpower to low birth rates lacks a cohesive link.\nJustification for Language: The language used in the essay is mostly clear, yet it is marred by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'In addition to, it is a very important solution' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Many students in good universities are satisfied because their college have high-quality education, but students in low universities are dissatisfied because the quality of their classes is not good. Although some people think that higher education should be given only to good students, making education available to all students is better.\n          First of all, education inequality will decrease. Some students have a hard time to study because of their family or money. If the change of education is given only good students, these poor students will not get knowledge and education inequality will increase. However, if higher education become available for every students, student can learn regardless of their situation.\n          In addition to knowledge, better education make world better. Since the quality of lecture is depend on professor, academic performance can be effected by the quality of lecture. If students can study with well-made lecture, their performance will increase; as a result, a society will be improved.\n          Some argue that education should be available only to good students because they study hard to enter the university. However, the essence of university is to explore the truth. Therefore, if someone want to explore the truth, university should welcome them. \n          To sum up, the change of education should be given to all students. Since the knowledge is not belong to someone, every students should be guaranteed the right to learn. Also, if education is given to every students, inequality will decrease and the world become better.

Government force everyone to go to some of these schools such as elementary school by law, for help everyone to get educated; however, they don\u2019t force everyone to go to college. College teaches more specialized knowledge to help people to be more specialized, so they are called higher education. Some people believe that higher education such as college or university education should be available to all students; however, I think that it should be available only to good students. \nTo begin with, government use a lot of money to support colleges. All students in college must pay tuition fee which is very expensive. Now days, government help most of students to pay for only half of their tuition fee by using their budget. According to one interview, almost 90 percent of college students answered that they have experienced help from government\u2019s half tuition fee project. When college education be available to all students, huge amount of money will be wasted because of the students who are not good at studying. \nIn addition, society does not need to have too much specialized people. Contents people learn in college are very specialized. In schools such as middle school, people learn about things that are necessary for living in our society. College teaches people about very specialized contents which will help them to get better jobs, however. Since there is no need for every people to be specialized, college are not necessity for all people.  \nSome people argue that higher education should be available to all students because people should get chance to get higher education. However, every people get equal chance to get higher education, so this argument does not hold. Every people get equal chance to do better work and to be better students before entering higher education. When they become good students, they will get chance to enter for higher education. \nTo sum up, government use a lot of money to support colleges and society does not need to have too much specialized people. All students do not have to feel like they must have to get higher education. \n\n\n\nSome people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students.

There are some reasons to go there such as to getting their future job. Some other students do not go to the university or college, so they learn some skills for their job. For example, some people learn how to make a pen, so they get a job in pen factory. Although many people prefer to go to the university or college, it is not necessary for several reasons.\nFirst of all, all students do not have ability to study in there. Many students just go to the university, yet they do not want to go. They just go there because of their parents or teachers. After go university, they do not have some responsibility. Because of this, some students do not prepare to study in university. These students may be hard to following the courses in university.\nIn addition, there are many ways for their future. Many people think that people have to graduate the university to get a job; however, there are many people get their job even do not graduate the university. For example, someone learn how to make a micro chip after he graduate the high school. After several years, he become expert of that area. It is not only way to success their life.\nSome argue that go to the university is necessary because if they graduate the university or college, they can expect to get grate job; however, they can also get some high quality of jobs without graduate from university. For example, Bill Gates drop the university; however, he become one of the famous people in the world. Many people will say he success he\u2019s life. To success life and getting a great job not necessary certification of graduation. It requires just your abilities and efforts.\nTo sum up, some people hard to follow the course in university because they do not prepare to study in university, so they do not have some ability to study in there. In addition, there are some other ways to get some job or success their life. For example, if they learn some skills the society needed, they will be needed you, so people just do their best in their area. Then, success will be followed.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument against the necessity of university education for success, but it lacks depth in examples, such as the vague reference to 'some people learn how to make a pen' without elaboration on skills or success stories.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 reflects a logical flow of ideas, yet the essay suffers from a lack of clear transitions between points, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing student responsibility to alternative paths to success without a cohesive link.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 is appropriate given the frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, exemplified by the incorrect use of 'After go university' instead of 'After going to university,' which detracts from the clarity of the argument."}]}

Some live there because of the distance, while some of them live dorm because of the cost. Although some students want to have a chance to make friends with roommates which university make for, dormitory is, in my opinion, some kind of house for students, so students should choose their own roommates. First, there could be a trouble if a student who school assign for the student. Next, students could their own hobby or interest with roommate who chosen by them.\nTo begin with, students spend their own time on the dormitory, and it is important to feel comfortable on that time. People have all different own character, it is same for the students. Thus, the roommate that is not own roommate would make a significant difference between them; then, the room could not be the best place to rest and they would always fight. In my own case, I was used the random roommate 2 years ago. At the first meeting, he seems to be a good person; however, few weeks later, he was not a clean man. He took a shower once per three days and left food for a one week on the desk. The smell of the room was terrible and the room was not feeling good for me. \nOn top of that, as mentioned earlier, students spend a lot of time on their dorm. Students are not a machine for studying, so they should play for a several hours then they enjoy their own time as well. At that time, roommate could be a best partner to play with. Although random roommate could have the same hobby, the possibility is too low and if they choose their roommate, then it is one hundred percent coincidence with the roommate. Also, if the roommate has different interest, he or she have to find out friends outside of the dorm; it might be a time wasting.\nOn the other hand, some might say that random roommates could be a opportunity to make a new friend. Because there are not that much time for playing, they can easily contact a new person without effort. However, there are so many clubs in universities and it could be the better chance than the random roommate. They have the same interest, and it could help them more familiar easily.\nTo sum up, it could be a hard time for students when they are not matched on lifestyle which make problem between them. Assigning is not an efficient way for students rest as well. In addition, they have lots of other manner to make a new friend. Therefore, the university are not responsible for assigning the roommate because it could make the better result if students choose.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 3.5/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 10.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 3.5 is justified because while the essay presents the argument for choosing roommates based on personal compatibility, it lacks depth and clarity, as seen in the vague statement, 'there could be a trouble if a student who school assign for the student,' which does not clearly articulate the potential issues with assigned roommates.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 is appropriate because the essay has a basic structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion; however, the flow of ideas is interrupted by awkward phrasing, such as in the transition between discussing personal experiences and general arguments, which diminishes coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 reflects the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'it is same for the students' and 'the room was not feeling good for me,' which hinder the overall readability and clarity of the essay."}]}

This education is optional.  Some people claim that only qualified students should go to college; however, in my opinion, the chance of higher education should be provided to every student.  \nFirst, one can make valuable relationships with the people met in college. In a college, students not only take the lecture but also participate in diverse activities such as attending parties, playing sports, or join concerts. Through these events, one can make friendships with peers, seniors, and juniors. This relationship would help one\u2019s social life in the future. \nSecond, students get a potential career and financial benefits. Some jobs require licenses which only can get through a college education or bachelor's degree. Also, many companies offer internships to only college students. Students provided a more diverse option when getting higher education such as entering graduate schools\nIt may be true that for some students, high tuition would be a burden. However, the Korean system of scholarship support is systematic and effective. Students can get enough support from the public scholarship foundation called \u2018KOSAF\u2019. Also, the private scholarship foundation offers tuition, too.  Many schools are making tuition-free for students from poor families. \nTo sum up, higher education is beneficial for future careers and making relationships.

Some people believe that a college education should be available to all students. However, allowing only good students to attend college is more helpful for students.\nFirst of all, a class is more suitable for students. If the college is open to all students, there will be students of various levels. Their level of knowledge and understanding will vary widely, so it will be difficult to set the level of the class and proceed. When the student\u2019s levels are somewhat high and constant, they will be able to have a more appropriate education and improve their knowledge.\nIn addition to suitable education, student\u2019s knowledge can be improved through competition. If students have similar knowledge level and when they are all study hard, they will compete among themselves. Through competition, students will study harder and concentrate on their studies to fill their shortcomings.\nSome people argue that allowing only good students to attend college is unfair. While it is true that everyone should have the same opportunity. However, the quality of education and atmosphere of class should be guaranteed because students pay tuition fees. When only good students attend to college, the atmosphere of the class is even better because students who want to study hard gathered. \nTo sum up, limiting the level of students who can attend college is important for students. Students can take classes that fit their levels, and they can compete each other and develop themselves.

Usually, even if students are not good at studying, they can enter college if they pay money. At some point, everyone is considered to have to graduate college of university. Some argue that college or university education should be available to all students because of equality of opportunity. But there are several reasons why only good students should get a high level of education.\nFirst, if everyone gets a higher education, a lot of the country's money will be spent on education. Students who do not want to study do not have to spend a lot of money on education. Rather, using this money to create jobs would make society more efficient.\n     In addition to that, different people have different talents, and not all those with different talents do things that require higher education. For example, in the case of street cleaners or chefs, high education is not necessary. Of course, high degree of education may help them do their job, but it is questionable whether it is worth spending that much time and money.\n     Some argue that higher education makes society better by raising everyone's standards. Even if that is true, competition becomes fiercer when everyone becomes highly educated. Even if there is no need for higher education to some jobs, there will be a phenomenon of preferring those who graduated from university, so that they will become obsessed with graduating from universities that were useless like Korea now.\n     In short, giving everyone the opportunity for higher education is a waste of money and intensifies competition. Also, not all jobs require higher education. Therefore, the government should try to provide educational opportunities that meet individual talents and goals.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument against universal higher education, but it lacks in-depth examples and supporting evidence, such as the assertion that 'a lot of the country's money will be spent on education' without specific data or examples to substantiate this claim.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is warranted because the essay follows a logical structure with clear topic sentences for each paragraph, but the transition between ideas could be smoother, as seen in the abrupt shift from discussing financial implications to the value of different talents.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay demonstrates a good command of English with some varied vocabulary, but it contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'high degree of education' instead of 'high degrees of education' which detracts from the overall clarity."}]}

In Korea, a lot of people go to university; however, some people think that university should be available only to good students. Although not every job needs to have academical information, university should open to everyone.\nFirst of all, chances have to be open to everyone. It is not fair to restrict their probabilities to grow to be a well-educated person only because he or she didn\u2019t do well in the past. For example, a boy who didn\u2019t study well in high school can realize that he should study very hard to earn a lot of money after graduating high school. If there is no chance for that person to study in a university, he may be very disappointed and have a hard time finding what he is going to be in the future.\nSecond, universities not only teach professional information but also leadership and communication skills through a lot of social activities and group homework. These skills are important to be a good worker because they need to work with many and various people when they get a job. Since universities can teach them, everyone should be able to get university education.\nOn the other hand, some people say that university or college education should be open only to students who did well in high school because not every job needs professional and academic education. However, although it seems that some jobs need only simple information, for students who want to have ability to improve themselves, they need more education.\nIn conclusion, everyone should be available to get college or university education because they should have chances to be a well-educated person. Also, universities teach leadership and communication skills that are important to be a good worker. University and college education can make students to be a better person in the future. These are the reasons why university and college education should be open to everyone.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 5.0/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 14.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 5.0 is justified as the essay effectively presents a clear argument for why university education should be available to all students, supported by examples such as the potential for a boy who did not perform well in high school to realize his need for education and work hard to improve his situation.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is appropriate, as the essay generally follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion; however, it could benefit from smoother transitions between points, such as providing clearer connections between the discussion of skills learned in university and their application in the workforce.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted since the essay uses mostly clear and appropriate language, but it includes grammatical errors, such as 'to grow to be a well-educated person' which could be more effectively expressed as 'to become a well-educated person.'"}]}

Since nowaday\u2019s technology is too improved, it is true that creative thinking in natural science fields is also required. Currently, some argue that students also practice this creative thing with taking various type of classes in KAIST, and previous university prepares this type of routines for students. However, taking specific subject of courses need in KAIST for several reasons.\nFirst of all, KAIST has purpose of growing skillful engineers. KAIST established in 1960s with purpose of development for science and engineering of Korea, and studying this long historical academy required not 1-2 years. In other words, serving specific subject class will be more acceptable.\nIn addition to school\u2019s purpose, structure of natural science can be reason. Today\u2019s science have close connection with the other field of science, and taking one courses actually require more information of subjects to students. In other words, even if students takes specific subject of courses, it is also grow students unconsciously. \nSome argue that creative thinking needs various fields of informations. It seems that have correct logic, but there is a mistake in it. This argument has assumption that students have fluent thinking in this various fields; however, enginering is too large that undergraduate students cannot cover all of it in 4 years. \nTo sum up, KAIST serves to students with one specific rountine for study. It satisfied their foundation purpose, give informations in various fields, and grow students to think fluently.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 3.5/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for the necessity of specific course routines at KAIST, but it lacks depth in providing specific examples or evidence to support its claims, such as the mention of 'the purpose of growing skillful engineers' without elaborating on how specific courses achieve this.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay follows a logical structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but it suffers from awkward transitions between ideas, particularly in the phrase 'In addition to school\u2019s purpose, structure of natural science can be reason,' which could be clearer.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 3.5 reflects the essay's moderate clarity, but it contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'it is true that creative thinking in natural science fields is also required,' which detracts from the overall readability and professionalism of the essay."}]}

It is always difficult to decide what classes to take for next semester. Some people say that students should learn various subjects during their college life; however, in my perspective, students should concentrate on one subject because specialized students are better for getting a job and being a fast learner. \nSpecialized students are easy to get a job than generalized students. In job market, needs of employers are clear, which is hiring people who can help their work right after they hire. Specialists are easy to start their work right after graduation because they know deeply about their field which is enough for starting practical work. In my personal experience, I start to work as designer because I learned deeply about design process with several classes about design.  \nIn addition to job opportunity, learning one subject deeply increase the speed of learning. Every subject has stiff learning curve at first, for every subject has different perspective and needed knowledge; however, when student learns next advanced contents, they can learn faster and more efficient because student have already learned basic. For example, learning biology and history simultaneously is harder than learning advanced biology. \nOpponents would contend that learning various subject is important because it helps to have wide perspective. It is true; however, students do not have to widen their perspective in college. After graduation, especially in work, students will meet various of people with various major. Communicating with them can widen their perspective enough, besides if they want, they can study some basics of other subjects whatever they want. Thus, students do not have to learn various subjects on college. \nTo sum up, students should learn one subject deeply rather than various subject lightly. It has benefits on getting a job faster, and it is easier and faster to learn when they study based on their accumulated knowledge in one subject. Some may assist that students should learn various subject which can make broad point of view; however, it is better to get wide point of view after they graduation. Thus, in my perspective, students should be specialist, not a generalist. \n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 reflects the essay's strong argument for specialization, but it is weakened by a lack of detailed evidence, such as specific data or studies to support the claim that specialized students are more employable.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear structure with distinct paragraphs for each main idea, yet it could be improved by enhancing the transitions between ideas to guide the reader more smoothly through the argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.5 is warranted given the generally clear expression of ideas, although it suffers from grammatical errors, such as 'is easy to get a job than generalized students,' which detracts from the overall clarity."}]}

Some universities insist that the students have to expand their knowledge by learning and integrating various fields. However, in my opinion, specializing in one subject have several fascinating advantages for students.\nThe first reason is that students can save their time to study. It is true that students have a lot to do, such as clubs, sports, hobbies, and talking with friends in addition to studying; also, there is not enough time to study one subject intensively. For example, in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, my major, lots of information have to be studied to familiarize with concepts, memorize formulas, and solve various application problems. Students in this major need enough time to study through all these processes. If students study deeply in their one subject, students will be able to become experts by practicing and learning enough about their major.\nIn addition to saving study time, students can get less stress from studying. When students take lots of subjects, assignments and tests in various fields increase; in addition, these tasks and exams differ in the conditions required to complete the subject, such as enough time for coding in computer engineering and the ability to solve various problems in mathematics. To achieve these subjects with different personalities, students need a lot of effort and talent; as a result, the stress that students receive increases. Therefore, it is very stressful for students to accomplish various subjects at the same time.\nSome argue that students\u2019 knowledge can be broadened because all subjects are connected; also, taking classes in various subjects helps to develop the ability to apply through other subjects. Besides, they argue that students can find and enjoy their true interests by taking a variety of subjects. Even if there are these arguments, taking class in one subject is better for some reasons mentioned above.\nTo sum up, specializing one subject have lots of advantages for students. Students can save and control efficiently time to study and get less stress from learning various subjects. To improve better students\u2019 university life, concentrating on specific subjects is better option for students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.5/5\nOverall Score: 13.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively presents the advantages of specializing in one subject, exemplified by the argument that students can save time and become experts in their field; however, it lacks depth in addressing the counterarguments, which weakens its overall content score.\nJustification for Organization: The organization of the essay is mostly clear, as it follows a logical structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly in the counterargument section.\nJustification for Language: The language used in the essay is generally clear and coherent, as seen in phrases like 'students can save their time to study,' but there are grammatical errors, such as 'have several fascinating advantages,' which should be 'has' for subject-verb agreement, impacting the language score."}]}

University which teaches highly advanced and complex subjects has two types of education system. First type is teaching many subjects to students, and second type is teaching one subject to students. In my opinion, taking classes in many subjects has several advantages.\nFirst of all, taking classes in many subjects can be helpful for finding aptitude for students. Before attending to the university, students do not have enough time to conduct their aptitude or dream. It is a clear statement that high school and middle school education is not sufficient for finding aptitude in Korea. In fact, students are focus on getting good grade in high school and middle school to go to the good university. When student take classes in many subjects, they can find their aptitude and dream for their future; thus, they will set a goal and move forward to realize it.\nIn addition, it can provide the opportunity to find their hobby. Indeed, students do not have a chance to realize their real hobbies. Classes in universities such as football class, robot class, and game class would be a helpful class for finding real hobbies. Real hobbies that are in professional field such as manipulating a drone can not only release the stress of students but also recharge themselves batteries. After enjoying the hobbies, students can concentrate more on their tasks, and students will focus more on the class of their major.\nSome argues that taking classes in many subjects would be a detrimental system for developing their professional knowledge. Also, others argue that taking many subjects is wasting of time, and finding aptitude is up to the students. Even though opposite argument insists that taking classes in many subjects is not a helpful decision for students, it provides an opportunity to know and develop themselves. When finding their real hobbies and aptitudes, students will be happy in their university life. Taking classes in many subjects can lead to a virtuous cycle.\nIn conclusion, taking classes in many subjects would be a wonderful decision for students. However, it is an issue that needs to be decided by coordinating the opposition. After coordinating the opposition, it would be a perfect choice for students happy university life.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay presents several advantages of taking many subjects, such as helping students find their aptitude and hobbies, but it lacks specific examples or evidence to support these claims, which weakens its overall argument.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is generally well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion; however, the transition between ideas could be improved, particularly in the second paragraph where the shift from discussing aptitude to hobbies feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: While the language is mostly clear, there are notable grammatical errors, such as 'students are focus on getting good grade' instead of 'students focus on getting good grades,' which detracts from the overall readability of the essay."}]}

People who want to learn higher education and interact with colleagues enter to the university. Many of people argue that all students are eligible for studying in a colleague because they believe it is a right of them; people have a belief that all students can achieve higher academic goals. However, this claim is flawed because of these aspects:\nThe first reason that university should accept only good students is to keep a high quality of class. In other words, if all students have a chance to enter the university and register the classes, they rather cannot learn advanced contents in there. At the beginning of classes, professors check the academic level of students to determine the difficulty of the classes; however, when their level is varied, it is hard to control it. If professors fail to control the difficulty of classes, Students who have lower academic ability cannot follow the classes; on the other hand, good students who want to learn higher level of contents do not satisfy the classes. Therefore, anyone cannot take satisfying classes when students academic ability is totally different.\nIn addition to offer students high quality of classes, the degree of efforts can be the reason. That is, good students usually show more efforts in the classes, which have more possibility to achieve high academic goal. Academic ability cannot be gained without the efforts because there are lots of contents to learn in higher level of classes; therefore, people who showed remarkable grade in the universities have a common feature: the effort. Students who do not make efforts for studying cannot get high academic ability, which is a goal of university. Thus, it is necessary for colleges to choose only good students.\nAlthough some people argue that all students have the equal ability to learn high contents. However, unfortunately, it is obvious that peoples have the different academic ability. This can be an obstacle for learning high level of academic fields. For example, math is the one of the fields that sense is important; students who do not have good senses cannot study the higher level of math. \nIn conclusion, university should accept good students. If university accept all students, they cannot offer the high quality of classes due to difficulty of controlling the level of classes. Moreover, good students usually shows the high efforts in studying, which is the necessary condition to obtain high academic skills. Furthermore, there are fundamental difference in academic ability among students. Thus, it is recommended for colleges to choose good students, which may be better for both ordinary students and good students.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay presents a clear argument for why only good students should enter university, but it lacks sufficient evidence and examples to strongly support its claims, such as providing specific statistics or studies to illustrate the impact of varying academic abilities on class quality.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is generally well-organized with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, but it would benefit from smoother transitions between points, particularly between the second and third reasons, where the flow of ideas feels abrupt.\nJustification for Language: While the language is mostly clear, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'Many of people argue' and 'the degree of efforts can be the reason,' which detract from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

Some students major in only one subject and takes courses from the subjects; however, other students choose double major or takes classes in many subjects. Although some people feel that students should be specialized in one subject, university students have to take classes in many subjects.\nFirst of all, learning in many subjects helps students to understand each subjects. There are some similar logics or ideas in different subjects, and some subjects are basics for other subjects. For example, math itself is a wide and deep major, but it is basic for other science and engineering subjects. Therefore, students can study other subjects to get idea when they are having difficulties on understanding some subjects. If the students only take classes in one subject, students can easily get stuck and cannot proceed learning, for the one major uses same words, definitions and theories.\nIn addition, point of view for other subjects can be changed. For the university students, it is first time to study advanced subjects; therefore, students still do not know what majors they are good for or what majors they are interested in. If students keep to major in one subjects, they can find out the major is not fitted can be depressed. However, if students take classes in many subjects, they can find their favorites fast and change their main major.\nSome argue that specializing in one subject is needed to become an expert. However, students can learn in depth at graduate courses. The undergraduate courses are advanced, but they are also basics for the graduate courses. Therefore, becoming an expert is done in graduate courses, and students have to stack the basics in many subjects to study well in graduate courses.\nTo sum up, learning in many subjects can help students to study and to plan for their future. Choosing appropriate major is important for the university students. Therefore, the universities should require students to take classes in many subjects.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is appropriate as the essay presents a clear argument supporting the benefits of studying multiple subjects, but it lacks depth in some examples, such as when it states that 'there are some similar logics or ideas in different subjects' without elaborating on specific instances.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.0 reflects a coherent structure with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion; however, the transition between ideas could be improved, as seen when the essay abruptly shifts from discussing the benefits of multiple subjects to the argument for specialization without a smooth connection.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is justified because the essay demonstrates a competent use of language, yet it contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as 'students major in only one subject and takes courses from the subjects,' which affects clarity."}]}

However, for their graduation, some universities have policy about additional requirement for taking classes. Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. In my opinion, specializing in one subject has several benefits.\nFirst of all, by studying one subject deeply in several years, students can have expertise. Four years are considerably long period to learn something. The students who take one specific subject for four years would have deep knowledge about the subject; from basic to advanced. However, students who take several classes might have less deep knowledge about their major. \nIn addition, students can practice to focus on one specific subject for several years. After graduating the university, students should get their job and most of them might work for more than decade. It means that they should work for one company in one field. People who are not familiar to work in one field can have difficulties maintaining their job and possibly try to find other jobs. However, those who are trained to work in a specific field for a long time can maintain their job for a long period. Students have a chance to train this ability in their universities. By specializing in one subject for more than four years, students can learn the attitude for long-run.\nSome argue that, taking several subjects are helpful for students to increase variety of their knowledge. However, this is not what students should get in universities. Little knowledge in several subjects is actually not helpful for any of those fields. Universities are where students build their base in their major and get ready for the next level such as job or graduate school. With little knowledge in several subjects, students cannot go to the next level in any field.\nTo conclude, for expertise and training long term studying, specializing in one subject is better for students. It will help students to have robust basis for their major which can help them in further studying or job.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay effectively argues for the benefits of specializing in one subject, as seen in the claim that 'students can have expertise' through deep study, but it lacks sufficient counterarguments or examples to strengthen its position.\nJustification for Organization: The essay has a generally logical flow, as it introduces the topic and supports it with clear points, but the transition between ideas could be smoother, particularly between the second and third paragraphs, which feel somewhat disjointed.\nJustification for Language: While the essay's language is mostly clear, it contains grammatical errors, such as 'some universities have policy about additional requirement,' which detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism of the writing."}]}

The classes that students will be learning is important because it is related to their career path. Some universities require students to take classes in various subjects; however, I think that it is more helpful for students to specialize in only one subject.\n     First of all, specializing in one subject can increase students\u2019 achievement. If students study various subjects, the amount of study will increase significantly. Large amount of study gives lots of stress to students, which decreases their ability to learn. On the other hand, if students specialize in one subject, their achievement and ability to learn will increase because the amount of study will be reduced.\n     The second reason is that it can help students to study more intensively. Studying in various subjects interrupt students\u2019 concentration. If students are forced to learn subjects they are not interested in, the concentration of study will naturally decrease. Studying only one subject makes them study much more efficiently and intensively.\n     Some believe that taking various subjects is a great help in making career decisions. They argue that it is important to experience various fields to decide their career path. However, specialize in one subject is more helpful for students\u2019 career path. Studying various subjects makes students become confused when making career decisions.\n     To sum up, specialize in one subject is helpful for students in several ways. It increases the achievement and concentration of study, and it helps to decide career path. Students must work toward to their goals through various studies.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.5/5\nOrganization: 4.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 13.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.5 is justified as the essay presents a clear argument for specializing in one subject, supported by relevant reasons such as increased achievement and improved concentration; however, the argument could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples or evidence to support these claims.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 4.5 reflects the logical flow of ideas, with clear topic sentences for each paragraph, but the transition between the counterargument and the author's perspective could be smoother to enhance coherence.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted due to generally clear expression and appropriate vocabulary, though the essay contains several grammatical errors, such as 'the classes that students will be learning is important,' which affects the overall fluency and readability."}]}

Although these two types of education seem to be helpful to students, I think students should take classes in various fields. There are three reasons for my opinion though there can be a different opinion.\n      First of all, students can find their interests through taking many subjects because students actually don\u2019t know what they want to study. In KAIST, every freshman should take basic subjects in various areas such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Next year, students should select their major, so many students have one year to consider their interests and choose their future working industry. Furthermore, students can change their major when they are not first or second grades. College students are young, so they can receive chances to investigate many areas and find which area they want to be experts. \n      In addition, wide knowledge is good although that knowledge cannot be deep. One of my friend works at laboratory, and he always say that college students should take classes which are not their major. Because sometimes researcher does research by coming up with ideas which are not primarily related to his area. He is an electrical engineering researcher, but his research also uses biology. Generally, It is necessary to know more than one field if you want to success for your job.\n      Though some people insist that to specialize in one subject is a college job, it can be achieved by taking many subjects in college. KAIST students would be experts in many ways, for example, they are researchers, business people, and even startup people. KAIST students can learn various subjects, but it does not mean that they cannot be a specialist in one area. In my case, as I was a freshman, I don\u2019t know what I want to be. I just took classes from more than 2 majors, and I changed my major twice. I satisfied my decision, and now I know what I want to be and which major I am engage in.\nIn conclusion, pros and cons exist between two types of college education. Students can get advantages through taking various subjects; for example, they can find their interests, get wide knowledge, and be a specialist who contains various understanding. Becoming a specialist needs high efforts, so students should take more than one majors and study many subjects.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 4.0/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 12.0/15\n\nJustification for Content: The essay presents a clear argument in favor of taking classes in various subjects, supported by examples like the experience of KAIST students, but it lacks depth in exploring counterarguments, which weakens the overall persuasiveness of the argument.\nJustification for Organization: The essay is generally well-structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion; however, the transition between ideas, particularly in the second paragraph, could be smoother to enhance the flow of the argument.\nJustification for Language: While the language used is mostly clear and conveys the author's ideas, there are grammatical errors, such as \"one of my friend works at laboratory,\" which detract from the overall professionalism of the writing."}]}

In most universities, students can enroll in any class regardless of major. Taking classes in many subjects has various benefits. \n     First of all, students need to find where they are interested in by studying in many fields. When they are entering the university first time, they only studied at the high school level; therefore, they don\u2019t really know about their interest. Students don\u2019t know anything about the major and trendy research field. After they study many fields and search for them, students can find where they are interested and want to study more. For instance, there are no chances to meet the information of major research fields and professors who research in their major. The majority of students meet the first time in university-level information and consider for their future first time after they come to university.\n     In addition to finding interest, students can find where they are talented in. Students simply memorize information and take tests in high school; thus, they judge their talents only with test scores. In fact, a person's talent cannot be judged solely by the score of the test. While taking classes in different disciplines, students have the opportunity to judge their talents by comparing how well they can follow the class, how easy it is to understand, and how quickly ideas for assignments come to mind. After students enter the university, they should take many different field courses and need time to seriously think about their talents. In fact, at KAIST, there are many cases that students check their talent by taking courses in different fields and change their major. \n     Some people argue that focusing on one major is much advantageous when students enter to the company; however, it fits in the past and the present has changed. Today, globalization is progressing rapidly, and many companies are hoping for convergence talent. Since most of the modern technologies are convergent technologies, a collaboration between experts in various fields is important. A person who knows only one field is difficult to cooperate with other people because of a poor understanding of other fields. Students need to know the basics of various fields since college so that they can smoothly cooperate with experts in other fields when entering a company and developing or conducting projects. For example, in the part of researching smartphones, many fields such as battery, display, communication, UI, human-computer interaction, CPU, and semiconductor are converged to conduct research. Therefore, knowing the basics of each field makes it easier to come up with ideas on how to increase efficiency by fusion.\n     To sum up, the chance to take many classes in several majors are very important to students for some reasons. Students have to find where they are interested in and where they are talented, and they have to learn in many fields to get advantages in research after they enter to company. Students have to take classes in many subjects.\n\nResponse:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Content: 4.0/5\nOrganization: 3.5/5\nLanguage: 4.0/5\nOverall Score: 11.5/15\n\nJustification for Content: The content score of 4.0 is justified as the essay effectively presents multiple reasons for why students should take classes in various subjects, such as finding their interests and talents; however, the argument could be strengthened with more specific examples or data to support these claims, such as mentioning specific programs or statistics from universities.\nJustification for Organization: The organization score of 3.5 reflects a generally clear structure, but the essay lacks smooth transitions between ideas, particularly in the third paragraph where the shift from discussing talent to globalization feels abrupt and could benefit from clearer links to the main argument.\nJustification for Language: The language score of 4.0 is warranted as the essay demonstrates a good command of vocabulary and sentence structure, but there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as 'it fits in the past and the present has changed,' which detract from the overall clarity of the writing."}]}
